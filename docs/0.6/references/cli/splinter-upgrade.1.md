NAME
====

**splinter-upgrade** â€” Upgrades splinter file system state to database state

SYNOPSIS
========

**splinter** **upgrade** \[**FLAGS**\]

DESCRIPTION
===========
Upgrades splinter by importing data from the deprecated YAML state and node_id
files to a database. This tool searches for data in the `circuits.yaml`,
`circuit-proposals.yaml` and `node_id` files from the state directory. When the
upgrade is complete, the YAML state definitions will be renamed to
`circuits.yaml.old` and `circuit-proposals.yaml.old` respectively. The `node_id`
file will be renamed to `node_id.old`.

This command will also import data from `LMDB` files for transaction receipts
and commit hashes.

FLAGS
=====

`-h`, `--help`
: Prints help information

`-q`, `--quiet`
: Decreases verbosity (the opposite of -v). When specified, only errors or
  warnings will be output.

`-V`, `--version`
: Prints version information

`-v`
: Increases verbosity (the opposite of -q). Specify multiple times for more
  output.

OPTIONS
=======
`-S`, `--state-dir` `STATE-DIR`
: Specifies the storage directory. (Defaults to `/var/lib/splinter`, unless
`SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` or `SPLINTER_HOME` is set.)

`-C`, `--connect` `DB-URL`
: Specifies the URL or connection string for the PostgreSQL or SQLite database
used for Splinter state. The default SQLite database will go in the directory,
`/var/lib/splinter`, unless `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` or `SPLINTER_HOME` is set.

EXAMPLES
========
This example upgrades splinter by connecting to a PostgreSQL server
with the example hostname and port `splinter-db-alpha:5432`.

```
splinter upgrade -C postgres://admin:admin@splinter-db-alpha:5432/splinter
```

This example upgrades splinter connecting to the SQLite database
`./custom-sqlite.db` and using YAML state files from `./custom/dir`.

```
splinter upgrade -S ./custom/dir -C ./custom-sqlite.db
```

ENVIRONMENT
===========
The following environment variables affect the execution of the command.

**SPLINTER_STATE_DIR**

: Defines the default state directory for YAML state and SQLite. This is
overridden by the `--state-dir` flag

**SPLINTER_HOME**

: Defines the default splinter home directory, from which the state directory
is derived as `$SPLINTER_HOME/data`. This environment variable is not used if
either the `SPLINTER_STATE_DIR` environment variable or the `--state-dir` flag
is set.
