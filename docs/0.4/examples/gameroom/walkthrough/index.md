***NOTE:*** This document is a work in progress! We are updating the
walkthrough with details for Splinter 0.4 and converting it to Markdown. For
a complete version of the document, see the [Gameroom Technical Walkthrough
PDF](https://files.splinter.dev/docs/Gameroom_Walkthrough-Splinter_v0.3.4.pdf).

## Introduction

Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to revolutionize how businesses
communicate and transact. At Cargill, we are leading the revolution with
involvement in several open-source projects, including Hyperledger Sawtooth,
Hyperledger Transact, and Splinter. This document outlines an example application,
Gameroom, that uses technologies from each of these projects to demonstrate our
vision of using smart contracts to enhance business and customer relationships.

Privacy and confidentiality between trading partners are important capabilities
for (almost) all multi-party interactions. These capabilities are especially
critical in distributed applications. As a result, the technology stack behind
Gameroom differs from a common "shared-everything" blockchain design; instead,
it sculpts the underlying blockchain-like distributed ledger technology into a
sophisticated architecture that shares data only between the appropriate
participants. Parts of this walkthrough are written as a script, in several acts,
for which we recommend a dramatic reading (as if performed on stage by very
amateur actors). Each act is followed by a "behind the scenes" chapter that
describes the complex underlying technology and explains what really happens
when running the deceptively simple Gameroom application. A glossary at the end
defines the terms used by Splinter and the Gameroom application.

**Note**: This document is based on Splinter version 0.4. As Splinter matures,
some details may change (such as the exact format of messages).

## The Cast

**Alice**, an employee at Acme Corporation

**Bob**, a project leader at Bubba Bakery

**Yoda**, a VP at Yoyodyne Systems

**Zixi**, head of IT at Zymogen Industries

## The Setting
Two Splinter nodes are set up, one at Acme Corporation and one at Bubba Bakery.
Alice and Bob have each registered as a Gameroom user with an email address, a
private key, and a password.
[The Prequel](#the-prequel-setting-up-the-gameroom-application) explains the
details of node setup and user registration.

## Act I: Alice and Bob Create a Gameroom

### Scene 1: Alice logs into Acme's Gameroom application

Alice looks at the GAMEROOM APP LOGIN SCREEN in her browser.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/acme_gameroom_login_screen.svg %}
"Gameroom app Acme login screen"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Alice enters her EMAIL and PASSWORD. Clicks LOG IN.

Success. The browser now displays the ACME GAMEROOM HOME SCREEN.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/acme_gameroom_home_screen.svg %}
"Gameroom app Acme home screen"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Scene 2: Alice creates a new gameroom

Alice sees an empty MY GAMEROOMS sidebar (no gamerooms exist yet). Alice creates
a new gameroom by clicking on the **+** button next to My Gamerooms.

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene2_1.svg %}
"Gamerooms sidebar")

Alice sees the NEW GAMEROOM DIALOG.

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene2_2.svg %}
"New Gameroom dialog"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Alice looks at the OTHER ORGANIZATION pulldown list. She
selects BUBBA BAKERY.

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene2_3.svg %}
"Organization pulldown list")

Next, she enters a NAME for the new gameroom: Acme + Bubba.

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene2_4.svg %}
"New Gameroom dialog completed")

Alice clicks SEND.

The New Gameroom dialog is replaced with the Acme Gameroom home
screen. A TOAST NOTIFICATION tells Alice that her invitation
has been sent to Bubba Bakery.

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene2_5.svg %}
"Invitation successfully sent notification"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### INTERMISSION

Live performances should include an intermission at this point,
because there is a lot that just happened (see
[Behind the Scenes: A Look at Act I](#behind-the-scenes-a-look-at-act-i-alice-and-bob-create-a-gameroom)).

### Scene 3: Bob logs into Bubba Bakery's Gameroom application

BOB, muttering to himself, opens a BROWSER and searches for "tic tac toe". Gets
distracted by Wikipedia's list of games. Plays Quantum Tic Tac Toe Online for
20 minutes. Eventually hunts through his email for the right link and starts
the BUBBA BAKERY GAMEROOM APP.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene3_1.png %}
"Bubba Bakery login screen")

Bob logs in with his EMAIL and PASSWORD.

Success. The browser now displays the BUBBA BAKERY GAMEROOM HOME SCREEN.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene3_2.png %}
"Bubba Bakery home screen")

### Scene 4: Bob checks his notifications

Bob sees that he has a notification and clicks on the NOTIFICATION ICON. The
NOTIFICATION PANE shows an INVITATION from Alice.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene4_1.png %}
"Bubba Bakery home screen with notification from Alice")

### Scene 5: Bob accepts Alice's gameroom invitation

Time passes.
Eventually, Bob clicks the notification. The notifications pane
disappears and the INVITATIONS TAB is shown. Bob clicks the
`ACCEPT` button on Alice's invitation.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene5_1.png %}
"Bubba Bakery invitations")

### Scene 6: Alice sees that Bob accepted her invitation

Alice notices that she has a notification and clicks on the notification icon.
The NOTIFICATIONS PANE appears, with the happy news that Bob has accepted her
invitation and that the new Acme + Bubba gameroom has been created.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene6_1.png %}
"Acme notifications")

Alice clicks on the notification. The Notifications pane closes and Alice is
redirected to the ACME + BUBBA GAMEROOM SCREEN.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene6_2.png %}
"ACME + BUBBA GAMEROOM SCREEN")

Alice and Bob’s gameroom is ready. They can now play games.

## Behind the Scenes: A Look at Act I, Alice and Bob Create a Gameroom

### I-1. Behind scene 1: Alice logs into Acme's Gameroom UI

Gameroom uses Biome for user management, including authentication. For more
information, check out the
[Biome overview]({% link docs/0.4/concepts/biome_user_management.md %}).

When a user logs in, the user interface (UI) component of the Gameroom client
application works with the Gameroom REST API to check the user's email address
and password and to ensure the user has a public and private key pair. Each
Gameroom client communicates with a Gameroom daemon, using the Gameroom REST API
in order to authenticate a Gameroom user. The Gameroom REST API uses the Biome
REST API to authenticate the user credentials and to fetch key pairs associated
with the user. Biome is a part of the Acme Splinter daemon. Each Splinter daemon
stores the user credentials and keys in a local PostgreSQL database; user
passwords are hashed by the Gameroom client so that they remain secret.

#### I-1.1. Acme UI sends authorization request to Gameroom REST API

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_acme1.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon receives auth request")

When Alice clicks Log in, the Acme Gameroom UI hashes the password, then sends
an authorization request to the Acme Gameroom daemon, gameroomd. The Gameroom
daemon then makes several requests to the Biome REST API to verify the user.

The following request is sent to Acme's Gameroom daemon:

```
POST /users/authenticate
{
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "hashedPassword": "8e066d41...d99ada0d"
}
```

The UI does not reveal the user's password to the REST API because the password
is used to encrypt signing keys (as described in section I-2.3, step 5).

#### I-1.2. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to verify password

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_acme2.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon forwards auth request")

Once the Gameroom daemon receives the authentication request, the actual
authentication is handled by the Biome REST API. This authentication request
is sent from the Acme Gameroom daemon to the Biome REST API.

```
POST /biome/login
{
  "username": "alice@acme.com",
  "hashed_password": "56ec82cb...480cad32"
}
```

When the Biome REST API receives the authorization request for Alice, it fetches
the entry from the Acme Splinter daemon's local database associated with the
username and verifies the hashed password sent in the request.


![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_acme3.svg %}
"Splinter daemon verifies Alice's credentials")


The `user_credentials` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_credentials (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `user_credentials` table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>username</th>
    <th>password</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3</td>
    <td>alice@acme.com</td>
    <td>56ec82cb...480cad32</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the hashed password from the authentication request passes verification,
the Biome REST API will respond with a success response. This response includes
JSON Web Tokens, which enable the Gameroom REST API to make authorized requests
to the Biome REST API, without requiring the user to enter their password.
The refresh token included in the success response allows a new access token to
be issued, if the refresh token has not expired, when the original token issued
has expired. Each refresh token issued is saved to the `refresh_tokens` table in
the Splinter daemon database, with an associated user ID.

The `refresh_tokens` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS refresh_tokens (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    token TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `refresh_tokens` table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>token</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>1</td>
    <td>06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3</td>
    <td>zeFgbILi...opBrt4ic</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the credentials are verified, the Biome REST API will respond with the
following success response:

```
{
  "message": "Successful login",
  "user_id": "06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3",
  "token": "eyJhbGci...adQssw5c",
  "refresh_token": "zeFgbILi...opBrt4ic",
}
```

#### I-1.3. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to request Alice's key pairs

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_acme4.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon requests Alice's keys")

Once the Gameroom daemon has verified Alice's password, it must then verify that
Alice has a public and private key pair. Alice's public and private key pair was
added to the Acme Splinter database during registration (see
[The Prequel, section P.2](#p2-registering-a-user-in-the-gameroom-ui)).

The request to list Alice's associated keys is made to the Biome REST API.

```
GET /biome/keys
```

The request to the Biome REST API's keys endpoint holds Alice's
JSON Web Token in an `Authorization` header, which will enable the Splinter
daemon to authorize access to the user's key information, as well as extract the
user ID from the token to fetch the keys from the Splinter daemon's database.


![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_acme5.svg %}
"Splinter daemon retrieves Alice's keys")


The `keys` table in the Splinter database has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS keys (
    public_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(public_key, user_id)
);
```

Using the unique `user_id` from the access token, the keys associated with Alice
are fetched from the Splinter daemon's database.

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `keys` table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>display_name</th>
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>public_key</th>
    <th>encrypted_private_key</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>alice@acme.com</td>
    <td>06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3</td>
    <td>0384781f...5a7e4998</td>
    <td>{\"iv\":...cgXrm\"}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the associated entry is found in the Splinter database `keys` table, a success
response with the list of key information is sent back to the Gameroom daemon.

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "public_key": "0384781f...5a7e4998",
      "user_id": "06ff2de0...9243ae2cf3",
      "display_name": "alice@acme.com",
      "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...cgXrm\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### I-1.4. Gameroom REST API returns login success response

If the Gameroom REST API gets a successful response from both requests sent to
the Biome REST API to verify the user, then the authentication was successful.

The Gameroom REST API sends a response to the Acme UI that contains Alice's
public key and encrypted private key.

```
{
  "email": "alice@acme.com",
  "public_key": "0384781f...5a7e4998",
  "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...cgXrm\"}",
}
```

Next, the UI must gather the information for the Acme Gameroom home screen that
Alice will see after logging in.

#### I-1.5. Acme UI requests a list of gamerooms

After a user has been authenticated, the UI gathers user-specific information for
the home screen. First, it requests the list of existing gamerooms for that user.
(At this point, no gamerooms exist.) Later, this walkthrough will describe what
happens when there are gamerooms for the UI to display.

1. When Alice logs in, the Acme UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the
list of gamerooms.

    ```
    GET /gamerooms
    ```

2. This call returns an empty list, since there are no gamerooms in the Acme
Gameroom's PostgreSQL database.

    ```
    {
      "data": [],
      "paging": {
        "current": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 0,
        "first": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0"
        }
    }
    ```

#### I-1.6. Acme UI requests a list of invitations
Next, the Acme Gameroom UI requests the list of gameroom invitations. In this
scenario, Alice has no invitations, so the list is empty. Later, the walkthrough
will show what happens when a user has unaccepted invitations.

1. When Alice logs in, the UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the list
   of invitations (also called _circuit proposals_).

    ```
    GET /proposals
    ```

2. Because Alice has no invitations, the Gameroom REST API returns an empty
   list.

    ```
    {
      "data": [],
      "paging": {
        "current": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 0,
        "first": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0"
        }
    }
    ```

    At this point, Alice sees the Acme Gameroom home screen with no existing
    gamerooms or invitations.

### I-2. Behind scene 2: Alice creates a new gameroom

The Gameroom home screen includes a button to create a new gameroom. When a user
clicks it, the UI requests the member list (possible other nodes) to use in the
next dialog.

After the Acme UI has the member list, it displays the "New
Gameroom" dialog, where Alice can use the members list to select her opponent
(called _Other organization_ in the dialog), and enter a name for the new
gameroom. When she clicks **Send**, the Acme UI starts the process of sending
Bob an invitation to the new gameroom.

A gameroom is enabled by a Splinter _circuit_ that connects two or more systems,
or _nodes_. A _registry_ stores a list of nodes that can participate in a
circuit; the Splinter daemon, `splinterd`, can provide this list of nodes upon
request. (The Gameroom example creates a registry that includes the Acme and
Bubba Bakery nodes.) Splinter uses the term _members_ for the nodes that can be
connected (or are connected) on a circuit.

A gameroom invitation is also called a circuit proposal. Each gameroom proposal
requires a vote (an _approval_) from each member, which is handled by two-phase
commit consensus and a _consensus proposal_. When Alice creates a new gameroom,
her action automatically includes a vote from her organization (Acme Corporation)
that approves the creation of that gameroom. Her invitation to Bob, at Bubba's
Bakery, is actually a request for his organization's vote to approve the new
circuit.

#### I-2.1. Acme UI loads members list for New Gameroom dialog

First, the Acme Gameroom UI must load the list of members for the "New Gameroom"
dialog. The general process looks like this:

![]({% link docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/get_nodes_diagram.svg %}
"Splinter daemon loads member list")

1. The UI makes this REST API call to the Gameroom REST API.

    ```
    GET /nodes
    ```

2. The Gameroom REST API sends a GET request to the `/registry/nodes` endpoint
   in the Splinter REST API asking for the list of nodes.

3. The Splinter daemon, `splinterd`, fetches the list of nodes from the registry
   and sends a response to the Gameroom REST API that includes the requested
   data. The "list of nodes" response looks like this:

    ```
    {
      "data": [
      {
        "identity": "bubba-node-000",
        "display_name": "Bubba Bakery",
        "endpoints": [
          "tcps://splinterd-node-bubba:8044",
        ],
        "metadata": {
          "organization": "Bubba Bakery",
        },
        "keys": [
          "b1834871...2914a7f4",
        ],
      },
      {
        "identity": "acme-node-000",
        "display_name": "ACME Corporation",
        "endpoints": [
          "tcps://splinterd-node-acme:8044",
        ],
        "metadata": {
          "organization": "ACME Corporation",
        }
        "keys": [
          "0384781f...5a7e4998",
        ],
      }
      ],
      "paging": {
        "current": "/registry/nodes?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 2,
        "first": "/registry/nodes?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "/registry/nodes?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "/registry/nodes?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "/registry/nodes?limit=100&offset=0"
      }
    }
    ```

4. The Gameroom REST API forwards the response to the Acme Gameroom UI, which
   uses the list of nodes to build the members list in the New Gameroom dialog.

#### I-2.2. Acme UI sends new Gameroom proposal to Gameroom REST API

1. In the New Gameroom dialog, Alice enters a unique name for the gameroom
   (Acme + Bubba) and selects Bubba Bakery from the **Other Organizations** list.
   Then she clicks **Send** to forward her invitation to Bob.

     When Alice clicks on the **Send** button, the general process looks like
     this:

    ![]({% link
    docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/create_gameroom_diagram.svg %}
    "Create Gameroom proposal sent")

    The UI sends a "create new gameroom" request to the Gameroom REST API that
    includes the gameroom name (also called an _alias_) and list of other
    members, besides the requesting node, in the proposed gameroom. Member
    entries only include the node ID, as gameroomd fetches the necessary member information
    from the Splinter registry.

    The request (also called a _proposal_) looks like this:

    ```
    POST /gamerooms/propose
    {
      "alias": "Acme + Bubba",
      "members": [
        "bubba-node-000",
        ],
    }
    ```

2. The Gameroom REST API sends a GET request to the `/registry/nodes` endpoint
   in the Splinter REST API asking for the details of the proposed Gameroom
   member, using the node ID from the Acme UI "create new gameroom" request.

   This information is then used to complete the `CircuitManagementPayload`
   in the next step.

#### I-2.3. Gameroom REST API sends a `CircuitManagementPayload`

When the Acme Gameroom REST API receives the proposal request, it uses that
information to create a `​CircuitManagementPayload​`, which will eventually be sent
to the Acme Splinter daemon. Before sending the proposal request, the Gameroom
REST API asks the Gameroom UI to sign it with Alice's information.

1. The Gameroom daemon uses the information from the "create new gameroom"
   request and the response from the `/registry/nodes` endpoint to create a new
   `​CircuitManagementPayload​`.

    The following example shows a YAML representation of the
    `CircuitManagementPayload​`.

    **Application metadata​**:
    ``` yaml
    alias: Acme + Bubba ​// Gameroom name chosen by Alice
    scabbard_admin_keys:
      - <acme gameroomd public key>
    ```

    **Circuit definition​**:
    ``` yaml

    ``` yaml
    Action: CIRCUIT_CREATE_REQUEST
    requester: <public key of requester> ​// left empty by the REST API
    payload_sha512: <sha512 hash of the circuit definition described above>
    requester_node_id: acme-node-000
    ```

    **`CircuitManagementPayload​`**:
    ``` yaml
    header: <bytes of header described above>
    circuit_create_request: <circuit definition described above>
    signature: <signature of bytes of the header> ​// left empty by the​ ​REST API
    ```

    Note​ that the Gameroom REST API does not fill in the ​requester​ field in the
    header or the signature in the `​CircuitManagementPayload​`.

2. Before the payload can be sent, the Acme UI must sign the bytes of the
   `CircuitManagementPayload` ​header. The Acme Gameroom REST API serializes the
   payload and sends the bytes as a response to the UI.

    ```
    {
      "data": {
        "payload_bytes": <bytes of the CircuitManagementPayload>
      }
    }
    ```

3. After receiving the response from the Gameroom REST API, the Acme UI
   deserializes the `CircuitManagementPayload​`. It adds the requester’s public
   key to the header (in this case, Alice is the requester), serializes the
   header, signs the header bytes, and adds the signature to the payload.
   Finally, the UI serializes the complete payload.

4. The Acme UI submits the bytes of the signed payload to the Gameroom REST API.

    ```
    POST /submit
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    <bytes of the signed CircuitManagementPayload>
    ```

5. The Acme Gameroom REST API forwards the payload to the Acme Splinter REST API.

    ```
    POST /admin/submit
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    <bytes of the signed CircuitManagementPayload>
    ```

6. The Acme Splinter REST API calls the Acme admin service to forward the
   proposed payload, a `​CircuitManagementPayload​` (described in the next
   section).

    The protobuf is represented in YAML format:
    ``` yaml
    CircuitManagementPayload:
      header: <bytes of header described above>
      circuit_create_request:
        circuit:
          01234-ABCDE:
            auth: trust
            members:
              acme-node-000:
                endpoints:
                  - tcps://splinterd-node-acme:8044
              bubba-node-000:
                endpoints:
                  - tcps://splinterd-node-bubba:8044
            roster:
              gr00:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - acme-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gr01
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>
              gr01:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - bubba-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gr00
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>
            persistence: any
            durability: none
            routes: require_direct
            circuit_management_type: gameroom
      signature: <signature of bytes of requested circuit definition>
    ```

7. The Acme admin service checks that the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` signature
   is valid by comparing it against the header bytes and the requester public
   key stored in the header.

8. Because the Acme and Bubba Bakery nodes are not yet peered (do not have an
   authorized connection on the Splinter network), the ​`CircuitManagementPayload​`
   is placed in the "unpeered payloads" queue for unpeered nodes.

#### I-2.4. Acme node peers with Bubba Bakery node

Before the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` message can be validated, every member of
the circuit must be connected (peered).

The admin service on the Acme Splinter node (which has the service ID
`admin::acme-node-000​`) is able to send requests using a `PeerManagerConnector`
to request the creation of a peer. The admin service also can use the
`PeerManagerConnector` to subscribe to notifications of the status of a peering
request. The `PeerManagerConnector` sends requests to the `PeerManager`. Peering
requests are counted by the `PeerManager` to ensure connections remain only as
long as they are needed.

1. Acme's admin service uses the `PeerManagerConnector.add_peer_ref` with the
   node ID and the endpoints listed in the proposed circuit to begin the peering
   process.

2. `PeerManagerConnector.add_peer_ref` sends a message,
   `PeerManagerRequest::AddPeer` including the `peer_id` and `endpoints`, is
   sent to the `PeerManager`. A `PeerRef` is returned to the admin service that
   represents the incremented count for peer requests to ensure the connection
   is maintained for as long as it is needed. The admin service must hold on to
   this `PeerRef` for as long as the peer is used.

3. The `PeerManager` receives the `PeerManagerRequest` message and uses
   `PeerManager.add_peer` to create the connection.

4. After the connection has been created, a message exchange starts for peer
   authorization (described in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-peer-authorization)).

5. If the connection is authorized, the connection is added to the Splinter
   network. The `PeerManager` then sends a `Connected` message to its
   subscribers.

6. Once the admin service has received the `Connected` message, the
   `​CircuitManagementPayload​` is removed from the `unpeered_payloads` queue
   and moved to `pending_protocol_payloads` queue. Peers' admin services with
   payloads in this list have yet to agree on a protocol version. Protocol
   versions are required to ensure the peers are running compatible versions of
   Splinter. This agreement must occur before any circuit management payloads
   can be handled. If these versions are not compatible, the payload will be
   dropped.

   The connecting admin service, Acme's admin service, sends a request which
   specifies the minimum and maximum protocol versions that it can support.
   Bubba's admin service responds with its highest supported version in the
   connecting service's range. If the admin service's agree on the protocol
   version, the admin service continues to process the payload.

7. Once Acme's and Bubba's admin services have agreed on a protocol version,
   the `CircuitManagementPayload` is moved to from `pending_protocol_payloads`
   to `pending_circuit_payloads`. The payload is now ready to go through
   consensus.

#### I-2.5. Splinter daemons use consensus to process the circuit request

At this point, the circuit proposal is ready to be validated and approved (voted
on with two-phase commit consensus), as described in
[Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus).

During this process, the admin services on both nodes (`​admin::acme-node-000​`
and `admin::bubba-node-000​`) must agree that the `​CircuitManagementPayload​`,
which includes `CircuitCreateRequest​`, is a valid request. Consensus manages
each node's approval of the proposal.

##### I-2.5.1. Acme node validates the CircuitManagementPayload

1. The Acme admin service verifies that the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` and the
   included `CircuitCreateRequest​` are valid.

    a. A `​CircuitManagementPayload​` request is valid if the following things are
       true:

      * The `​CircuitManagementPayload​` must contain a header and signature in
        bytes.

      * The header in the payload must contain an action enum value, the public
        key of the requester, and hash of the action associated with the payload.

      * The action in the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` must match the enum action
        in the payload.

      * The signature must be valid for the bytes of the header and the requester
        public key stored in the header.

    b. The provided payload (a `​CircuitCreateRequest​`) is valid if the following
       things are true:

      * The new circuit has a unique name (the node is not part of an existing
        circuit with that name). Circuit names do not need to be unique across
        all Splinter nodes. Two sets of nodes can use the same circuit name if
        there is no overlap in members in the circuit.

      * The circuit definition includes the node ID in the circuit member list.

      * For each service, every node in the service's allowed node list is also
        present in the circuit member list.

      * There is no other pending proposal for a circuit with the same name.

      * The requester is registered for the Splinter node whose ID is in the
        `requester_node_id​` field of the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` header. The
        requester is identified by the public key of the person who requested
        the new gameroom (in this example, Alice).

      * The requester has permission to submit circuit proposals from that
        Splinter node.

      To verify the node's public key and proposal permission, the admin service
      checks the Splinter registry and key permissions manager.

      * The Splinter registry provides a way to look up details about a node,
        including registered public keys. The registry will be used to verify
        the public key used to sign a circuit proposal: the requester node ID,
        (which should be associated with the "home node" in order for the
        request to be valid).

      * The key permissions manager checks that a public key is authorized in a
        specific role. In the case of "create circuit" requests, the signing
        public key must be authorized for the "proposal" role.

2. If the request is valid, the Acme admin service creates a
   `CircuitProposalContext` and stores it in the ​
   `AdminServiceShared.pending_changes` field. The `CircuitProposalContext`
   includes the the proposed circuit, represented in a `CircuitProposal` struct,
   also the `CircuitManagementPayload` action and the signer's public key. The
   protobuf for the `CircuitProposal` is represented in YAML format.

    ``` yaml
    CircuitProposal:
      proposal_type: CREATE
      circuit_id: 01234-ABCDE
      circuit_hash: <hash of circuit>
      circuit_proposal:
        circuit:
          01234-ABCDE:
            auth: trust
            members:
              acme-node-000:
                endpoints:
                  - tcps://splinterd-node-acme:8044
              bubba-node-000:
                endpoints:
                  - tcps://splinterd-node-bubba:8044
            roster:
              gr00:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - acme-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gr01
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>
              gr01:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - acme-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gr00
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>
            persistence: any
            durability: none
            routes: require_direct
      votes: []
      requester: <public key of requester>
      requester_node_id: acme-node-000
    ```

3. The Acme admin service creates a consensus proposal (a `​Proposal​` struct)
  with the following contents:

   * Proposal ID: the expected hash of the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` bytes

   * Summary: bytes of the created `​CircuitProposal`

   * List of required verifiers

    An admin service running on a Splinter node does not have a fixed (static)
    list of required verifiers (services that must agree on a proposal through
    consensus). Instead, the admin service specifies the required verifiers as a
    list of admin service IDs that belong to the members of the proposed circuit,
    using a protobuf message called `​RequiredVerifiers​`. This list is stored in
    the consensus data of the consensus proposal.

    The following protobuf, which is represented in YAML format, shows the
    consensus proposal.

    ``` yaml
    required_verifiers:
      verifiers:
        - <admin::acme-node-000 as bytes>
        - <admin::bubba-node-000 as bytes>

    proposal:
       id: <hash of `CircuitManagementPayload` bytes>
       summary: <bytes of the create `CircuitProposal`>
       consensus_data: <bytes of required verifiers>
    ```

##### I-2.5.2. Acme node sends Circuit Create request to Bubba Bakery node

After the Acme node creates the `​CircuitProposal​`, the `​CircuitManagementPayload​`
is sent to the other members defined in the circuit. In this case, the only
member is the admin service on the Bubba Bakery node.

1. First, the Acme admin service wraps `​CircuitManagementPayload​` in a series of
   messages to prepare it for sending across the Splinter network.

    a. The payload is wrapped in an `​AdminMessage​`, which is a service-level
       message. The protobuf is represented in YAML format.

    ``` yaml
    admin_message:
      message_type: PROPOSED_CIRCUIT,
      propose_circuit:
        circuit_payload: <circuit_managment_payload>
        expected_hash: <expected hash of CircuitProposal generated by payload>
        required_verifiers: <bytes of the required verifiers from proposal>
    ```

    b. The `​AdminMessage` ​is then wrapped in an `​AdminDirectMessage​`, which
       enables the message to be sent over the Splinter network from Acme's
       admin service to the Bubba Bakery admin service (which has the service ID
       `​admin::bubba-node-000​`).

    ``` yaml
    admin_direct_message:
      circuit: admin
      sender: admin::acme-node-000
      recipient: admin::bubba-node-000
      payload: <serialized admin message>
      correlation_id: 6f04e471-f33a-4f9f-ad6f-5f80ab627133
    ```

    c. Next, the `​AdminDirectMessage​` is wrapped in a `​CircuitMessage​`, which
       is the envelope that wraps all circuit-specific messages, such as direct
       messages and service connections.

    ``` yaml
    circuit_message:
      message_type: ADMIN_DIRECT_MESSAGE
      payload: <serialized admin_direct_message>
    ```

    d. In order to hide circuits from the network layer, which can be used without
       circuits, the `CircuitMessage​` is wrapped in a `​NetworkMessage​`.

    ``` yaml
    network_message:
      message_type: CIRCUIT
      payload: <serialized circuit_message>
    ```

2. The Acme admin service sends this message over the admin circuit to the Bubba
   Bakery Splinter node.

##### I-2.5.3. Bubba Bakery node receives Circuit Create request from Acme node

The Bubba Bakery Splinter node receives the network message from the Acme node
and starts the process of "unwrapping" the message with a series of dispatchers.

1. A dispatcher takes the message and passes it to the correct message handler
   based on the message type of the message. Each dispatcher either handles the
   message or forwards the message onto the next dispatcher.

    a. The Bubba Bakery Splinter node passes the `​NetworkMessage​` to the network
       dispatcher.

    b. The network dispatcher unwraps the `​NetworkMessage​` to get the
       `CircuitMessage​`, then sends it to the circuit dispatcher.

    c. The circuit dispatcher unwraps the `​CircuitMessage​` to get the
       `AdminDirectMessage​`, then passes it to the circuit handler for this type
       of message, `​AdminDirectMessageHandler​`.

2. The `​AdminDirectMessageHandler​` checks whether the `​AdminDirectMessage​` is
   valid. An `​AdminDirectMessage​` message is valid if both the sender and the
   recipients of the message are admin services (the service ID of each is of
   the form `​admin::<node_id>`​).

3. If the `​AdminDirectMessage​` message is valid, the `A​dminDirectMessageHandler​`
   forwards it to the Bubba Bakery admin service.

4. The Bubba Bakery admin service takes the `​AdminMessage​` out of the
   `​AdminDirectMessage` and inspects the `​AdminMessage​` to see if it contains
   `​AdminMessage::ProposedCircuit​`.

    If so, the admin service takes the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` out of the
    `​ProposedCircuit` message and passes it to
    `​AdminServiceShared.pending_circuit_payloads`.

##### I-2.5.4. Bubba Bakery node validates CircuitManagementPayload

The Bubba Bakery admin service validates the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` using
the same steps as in
[section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload).

1. The admin service verifies that the `​CircuitManagementPayload​` and the
   included `CircuitCreateRequest​` are valid. (For details, see
    [section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload),
   step 1​.)

2. If the request is valid, the admin service creates a `​CircuitProposal​` and
   stores it in the `AdminServiceShared.pending_changes​` field (see
   [section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload),
   step 2​).

3. The admin service creates a consensus proposal (a `​Proposal​` struct) with the
   proposal ID, summary, and the list of required verifiers. For more
   information, see
   [section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload),
   step 3​.

##### I-2.5.5. Acme and Bubba Bakery reach consensus

When the admin services have validated the proposal and consensus has reached
agreement, consensus will notify the admin services to commit the proposal.
See ​[Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus) for more information about consensus.

#### I-2.6. Admin services commit pending circuit proposal

After the consensus notification, both admin services commit the
`​CircuitProposal​`. Now the new circuit is officially pending, which means that
the `​CircuitProposal​` is stored in the admin services' state but the circuit is
not yet available for communication. A pending circuit proposal is also called
an "open circuit proposal".

In the Gameroom example, the pending circuit ID is an 11-character string composed
of two 5-character base-62 numbers separated by a dash, '-'. In this walkthrough,
we'll use this example circuit ID:

`01234-ABCDE`

#### I-2.7. Admin services notify authorization handler of pending circuit proposal

1. After the circuit proposal has been committed, the admin service on each node
   checks if there are any registered application authorization handlers for the
   circuit management type in the proposed circuit
   (​`01234-ABCDE`​). See The Prequel,
   [section P.3](#p3-registering-the-gameroom-daemon-for-admin-service-events),
   for more information on the registration process.

   An application authorization handler manages the voting strategy for the
   application and notifies the application of any events received from the
   admin service of the local Splinter node. This handler registers with an
   admin service for a specific circuit management type (also described in
   ​The Prequel,
   [section P.3](#p3-registering-the-gameroom-daemon-for-admin-service-events).


2. If there are any registered application authorization handlers for the
   proposed circuit management type, each admin service forwards the request
   to the local connected Gameroom application authorization handler.

   The notification is sent on a WebSocket connection.

#### I-2.8. Gameroom daemons write notification to Gameroom database

When each Gameroom application authorization handler receives the gameroom
proposal on the WebSocket connection, it parses the information and adds it to
several tables in the Gameroom daemon's local database: `​gameroom​`, ​
`gameroom_member​`, `​gameroom_service​`, `gameroom_proposal​`, and
`​gameroom_notification​`.

##### I-2.8.1. New `gameroom` table entry

First, the Gameroom application authorization handler adds a new entry to the
​gameroom​ table. This table contains the information about the circuit
definition, including the data that was passed in the ​application_metadata​ field.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  gameroom (
  circuit_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  authorization_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  persistence TEXT NOT NULL,
  routes TEXT NOT NULL,
  durability TEXT NOT NULL,
  circuit_management_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  alias TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
);
```

* `circuit_id`, `authorization_type`, `persistence`, `routes`, `durability`,​ and
  `circuit_management_type` ​are extracted directly from the circuit proposal
  message that is received from the Splinter daemon.

* `alias​​` is extracted by deserializing the application metadata in the circuit
  proposal message. The _alias_ is the gameroom name that Alice entered when
  creating the gameroom in the Acme UI.

* `status​` identifies the current status of the gameroom. In this case, it is
  set to ​pending because the proposal to create this gameroom has not yet been
  accepted.

* `created_time` is when the gameroom entry was introduced in the table.

* `updated_time` is when the gameroom entry was last updated.

At the end of the operation, the `​gameroom​` table looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>circuit_id</th>
    <th>authorization_type</th>
    <th>persistence</th>
    <th>routes</th>
    <th>durability</th>
    <th>circuit_management_type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>Trust</td>
    <td>Any</td>
    <td>Any</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>gameroom</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>alias</th>
    <th>status</th>
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>updated_time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Acme + Bubba</td>
    <td>pending</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### I-2.8.2. New `gameroom_member` table entry

Next, the Gameroom application authorization handler adds a new entry to the
`gameroom_member​` table. This table contains the information about the members
of the circuit.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  gameroom_member (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  circuit_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  node_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  endpoint TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_time TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_time TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (circuit_id) REFERENCES gameroom(circuit_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

* `circuit_id`, `node_id`,​ and `e​ndpoint` ​are extracted directly from the
  circuit proposal message received from the Splinter daemon.

* `status` identifies the current status of the member. In this case, it is set
  to `pending` because the proposal to create the gameroom has not yet been
  accepted.

* `created_time` is when the gameroom member entry was introduced in the table.

* `updated_time` is when the gameroom member entry was last updated.

At the end of the operation, the `​gameroom_member​` table looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>circuit_id</th>
    <th>node_id</th>
    <th>endpoint</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>acme-node-000</td>
    <td>tcps://splinterd-node-acme:8044</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>bubba-node-000</td>
    <td>tcps://splinterd-node-bubba:8044</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>status</th>
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>updated_time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pending</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pending</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### I-2.8.3. New `gameroom_service` table entry

The Gameroom application authorization handler adds a new entry to the
`​gameroom_service` table, which contains the information about the services of
the circuit.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  gameroom_service (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  circuit_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  service_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  service_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  allowed_nodes TEXT[][] NOT NULL,
  arguments JSON [] NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_event TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (circuit_id) REFERENCES gameroom(circuit_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

* `circuit_id`, `service_id`, `service_type`, `arguments` and `allowed_nodes`
  are extracted directly from the circuit proposal message received from the
  Splinter daemon.

* `status` identifies the current status of the service. In this case, it is set
  to `pending` because the proposal to create the gameroom has not yet been
  accepted.

* `last_event` identifies the last state change event the gameroom daemon
  received. This allows for the node to catch-up to current state change events
  if it has been stopped and restarted.

* `created_time` is when the gameroom service entry was introduced in the table.

* `updated_time` is when the gameroom service entry was last updated.

At the end of the operation, the `gameroom_service` table looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>circuit_id</th>
    <th>service_type</th>
    <th>service_id</th>
    <th>allowed_nodes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>scabbard</td>

    <td>{"acme-node-000"}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>scabbard</td>
    <td>gr01</td>
    <td>{"bubba-node-000"}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>status</th>
    <th>last_event</th>
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>updated_time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pending</td>
    <td>&lt;last state change event&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pending</td>
    <td>&lt;last state change event&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### I-2.8.4. New `gamerooom_proposal` table entry

The Gameroom application authorization handler adds a new entry to the
`gameroom_proposal` table, which contains the information about the gameroom
proposal.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  gameroom_proposal (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  proposal_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  circuit_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  circuit_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  requester TEXT NOT NULL,
  requester_node_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (circuit_id) REFERENCES gameroom(circuit_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

* `circuit_id`, `proposal_type`, `circuit_hash`, `requester` and
  `requester_node_id` are extracted directly from the circuit proposal message
  received from the Splinter daemon.

* `status` identifies the current status of the proposal. In this case, it is
  set to `pending` because the proposal to create the gameroom has not yet been
  accepted.

* `created_time` is when the gameroom proposal entry was introduced in the table.

* `updated_time` is when the gameroom proposal entry was last updated.

At the end of the operation, the `​gameroom_proposal​` table looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>circuit_id</th>
    <th>proposal_type</th>
    <th>circuit_hash</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>Create</td>
    <td>&lt;hash of circuit definition&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>requester</th>
    <th>requester_node_id</th>
    <th>status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;public key of requester&gt;</td>
    <td>acme-node-000</td>
    <td>pending</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>updated_time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### I-2.8.5. New `gameroom_notification` table entry

Finally, the Gameroom application authorization handler adds a new entry to the
`gameroom_notification​` table. This table contains information about events that
the UI would like to notify the users about.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  gameroom_notification (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  notification_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  requester TEXT NOT NULL,
  requester_node_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  target TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  read BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
);
```

* `notification_type` identifies the type of event that generated this
  notification (in this case, a `gameroom_proposal` event).

* `requester` identifies the public key of the user that generated the event
  (in this case, Alice's public key).

* `target` is the identifier for the resource that was affected by the event
  (in this case, the `circuit_id`).

* `created_time` is when the notification entry was introduced in the table.

* `updated_time` is when the notification entry was last updated.

At the end of the operation, the `gameroom_notification` table looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>notification_type</th>
    <th>requester</th>
    <th>requester_node_id</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>gameroom_proposal</td>
    <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
    <td>acme-node-000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>target</th>
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>read</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>f</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### I-2.9. Alice sees notification that gameroom invitation was sent

1. After the Acme Gameroom application authorization handler fills in the
   `gameroom_notification​` table, the Acme Gameroom REST API uses a WebSocket
   connection to tell the Acme UI about the new notification.

    ```
    {
      "namespace": "notifications",
      "action": "listNotifications"
    }
    ```

2. When the Acme UI receives that message, it sends a request to the Gameroom
   REST API to fetch a list of unread notifications from the database tables.

    `GET /notifications`

3. The Acme Gameroom REST API responds with the list of unread notifications.

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": <auto generated id>,
          "notification_type": "gameroom_proposal",
          "requester": <Alice’s public key>,
          "node_id": "acme-node-000",
          "target": "01234-ABCDE",
          "timestamp": <time entry was created>,
          "read": false
        }
      ],
      "paging": {
        "current": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 1,
        "first": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0"
      }
    }
    ```

4. The Acme UI updates its internal store with the new list of notifications.
   The notification that the user sees depends on whether they're the requester
   or an invitee.

    * For the requester (Alice), the Acme UI displays a toast notification
      saying that the invitation has been sent.

    * An invitee sees a bell notification icon with number (a red badge that
      shows the number of unread notifications). If an invitee is not logged in,
      the notification will appear on the Gameroom home screen when the user
      logs in. For example, when Bob logs in, the Bubba Bakery UI will request
      the list so it can display the notification icon and the number on the
      home screen.

### I-3. Behind scene 3: Bob logs into Bubba Bakery's Gameroom application

When Bob logs in, the Bubba Bakery UI works with `gameroomd`, `splinterd`, and
both the Splinter and Gameroom REST API to check his user credentials and build
the Bubba Bakery Gameroom home page. This process is almost identical to Alice's
login process. The only difference is that the Bubba Bakery Gameroom home page
will display a notification about his invitation from Alice.

#### I-3.1. Bubba Bakery UI sends authorization request to Gameroom REST API

This process is the same as the Acme process in [section
Ⅰ-1.1](#i-11-acme-ui-sends-authorization-request-to-gameroom-rest-api).
For Bob, the general process looks like this:

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_bubba_1.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon receives auth request")

When Bob clicks `Log in`, the Bubba Bakery Gameroom UI hashes the password,
then sends an authorization request to the Bubba Bakery Gameroom daemon,
`gameroomd`. Then, the Gameroom daemon makes some requests to the Biome REST
API to verify the user.

```
POST /users/authenticate
{
  "email": "bob@bubbabakery.com",
  "hashedPassword": "2b944c69...c11fcf9c"
}
```

As mentioned earlier, the UI does not reveal the user's password to the REST
API because the password is used to encrypt signing keys.

#### I-3.2. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to verify password

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_bubba_2.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon retrieves user credentials")

After the Gameroom daemon has received the authentication request, the
authentication is handled by the Biome REST API. The authentication request
is sent from the Bubba Bakery Gameroom daemon to the Biome REST API.

```
POST /biome/login
{
  "username": "bob@bubbabakery.com",
  "hashed_password": "2b944c69...c11fcf9c",
}
```

When the Biome REST API receives the authorization request for Bob, it fetches
the entry from the Bubba Bakery Splinter daemon's local database associated with
the username and verifies the hashed password sent in the request.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_bubba_3.svg %}
"Splinter daemon verifies Bob's credentials")

The `user_credentials` table in the Splinter database has the same schema as
described earlier in
[section I-1.2](#i-12-gameroom-daemon-uses-biome-rest-api-to-verify-password).
For Bob, the Splinter database has the following entry in the `user_credentials`
table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>username</th>
    <th>password</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>9g3rmce0...9823citbg5</td>
    <td>bob@bubbabakery.com</td>
    <td>2b944c69...c11fcf9c</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If the hashed password from the authentication request passes verification,
the Biome REST API will respond with a success response. This response includes
JSON Web Tokens, which enable the Gameroom REST API to make authorized requests
to the Biome REST API, without requiring the user to enter their password.
The refresh token included in the success response allows a new access token to
be issued, if the refresh token has not expired, when the original token issued
has expired. Each refresh token issued is saved to the `refresh_tokens` table in
the Splinter daemon database, with an associated user ID.

The `refresh_tokens` table in the Splinter database has the same schema as
described in section
[section I-1.2](#i-12-gameroom-daemon-uses-biome-rest-api-to-verify-password).
Once Bob has logged in, the Splinter database has the following entry in the
`refresh_tokens` table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>token</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>1</td>
    <td>9g3rmce0...9823citbg5</td>
    <td>gy9ubMNu...tyV87rco</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If Bob's credentials are verified, the Biome REST API will respond with the
following success response:

```
{
  "message": "Successful login",
  "user_id": "9g3rmce0...9823citbg5",
  "token": "ihGhBIxc...923bby17",
  "refresh_token": "gy9ubMNu...tyV87rco",
}
```

#### I-3.3. Gameroom daemon uses Biome REST API to request Bob's key pairs

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_bubba_4.svg %}
"Gameroom daemon requests Bob's keys")

Once the Gameroom daemon has verified Bob's password, it must then verify that
Bob has an associated public and private key pair. Bob's public and private key
pair was added to the Bubba Bakery Splinter database during registration (see
[The Prequel, section P.2](#p2-registering-a-user-in-the-gameroom-ui)).

The request to list Bob's associated keys is made to the Biome REST API.

```
GET /biome/keys
```

The request made to the Biome REST API holds Bob's JSON Web Token in an
`Authorization` header, which enables the Splinter daemon to authorize access to
the user's key information, as well as extract the user ID from the token to
fetch the keys from the Splinter daemon's database.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/auth_login_bubba_5.svg %}
"Splinter daemon retrieves Bob's keys")

The `keys` table schema in the Splinter database has the schema as described in
section
[section I-1.3](#i-13-gameroom-daemon-uses-biome-rest-api-to-request-alices-key-pairs).
Using the unique `user_id` extracted from the access token, the public/private
key pair associated with Bob is fetched from the Splinter daemon's database.

The Splinter database has the following entry in the `keys` table:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>display_name</th>
    <th>user_id</th>
    <th>public_key</th>
    <th>encrypted_private_key</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>bob@bubbabakery.com</td>
    <td>9g3rmce0...9823citbg5</td>
    <td>b1834871...2914a7f4</td>
    <td>{\"iv\":...goPek\"}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If Bob's public/private key pair is found in the Splinter database `keys` table,
a success response with the list of key information is sent back to Bubba Bakery's
Gameroom daemon with Bob's associated keys.

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "public_key": "b1834871...2914a7f4",
      "user_id": "9g3rmce0...9823citbg5",
      "display_name": "bob@bubbabakery.com",
      "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...goPek\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### I-3.4. Gameroom REST API returns login success response

If Bubba Bakery's Gameroom REST API receives a successful response from the
requests made to verify Bob's credentials and keys, then the entire authentication
process was successful. Therefore, the Gameroom REST API is then able to send
a response to the Bubba Bakery UI that contains Bob's public/private key pair.

```
{
  "email": "bob@bubbabakery.com",
  "public_key": "b1834871...2914a7f4",
  "encrypted_private_key": "{\"iv\":\"...goPek\"}",
}
```

Next, the UI must gather the information for the Bubba Bakery  Gameroom home
screen that Bob will see after logging in.

#### I-3.5. Bubba Bakery UI requests list of existing gamerooms

As part of building the Bubba Bakery home screen for Bob, the UI requests the
list of Bob's gamerooms. This process is the same as the Acme process in
[section Ⅰ-1.4](#i-14-gameroom-rest-api-returns-login-success-response).

1. The Bubba Bakery UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the list of
   existing gamerooms.

    ```
    GET /gamerooms
    ```

2. The Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API returns an empty list, because there are
   no existing gamerooms in the Bubba Bakery Gameroom's PostgreSQL database.

    ```
    {
        "data": [],
        "paging": {
               "current": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
               "offset": 0,
               "limit": 100,
               "total": 0,
               "first": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
               "prev": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
               "next": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0",
               "last": "/gamerooms?limit=100&offset=0"
        }
    }
    ```

#### I-3.6. Bubba Bakery UI requests list of gameroom invitations

As part of building the Bubba Bakery home screen for Bob, the UI requests the
list of Bob's invitations. This process is different from the Acme process in
[section Ⅰ-1.5](#i-15-acme-ui-requests-a-list-of-gamerooms),
because Bob has a new invitation from Alice.

1. The Bubba Bakery UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for Bob's list of
   invitations (also called _circuit proposals_).

    ```
    GET /proposals
    ```

2. The Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API returns a list that includes Alice's
   invitation.

    ```
    {
        "data": [
            {
               "proposal_id": <auto-generated id>,
               "circuit_id": "01234-ABCDE",
               "circuit_hash": <hash of circuit definition>,
               "members": [
                   {
                       "node_id": "acme-node-000",
                       "endpoints": [
                        "tcps://splinterd-node-acme:8044",
                       ],
                   },
                   {
                       "node_id": "bubba-node-000",
                       "endpoints": [
                        "tcps://splinterd-node-bubba:8044"
                       ]
                   }
               ],
               "requester": <Alice's public key>,
               "requester_node_id": acme-node-000,
               "created_time": <time entry was created>,
               "updated_time": <time entry was updated>
            }
        ],
               "paging": {
                      "current": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
                      "offset": 0,
                      "limit": 100,
                      "total": 1,
                      "first": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
                      "prev": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
                      "next": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0",
                      "last": "/proposals?limit=100&offset=0"
               }
        }
    ```

#### I-3.7. Bubba Bakery UI queries for unread notifications

While building the Bubba Bakery home screen, the UI also requests the list of
Bob's unread notifications.

When the circuit proposal (Alice's invitation) was created, the Bubba Bakery
admin service stored Bob's notification information in the Gameroom database,
with the `read` field set to "false". For the details of how the Gameroom
tables were updated during circuit creation, see [section
Ⅰ-2.8](#i-28-gameroom-daemons-write-notification-to-gameroom-database)
and [section
Ⅰ-2.9](#i-29-alice-sees-notification-that-gameroom-invitation-was-sent).

1. The Bubba Bakery UI makes a call to the Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API for
   the list of Bob's unread notifications.

    ```
    GET /notifications
    ```

2. The Gameroom REST API queries the `gameroom_notification` table and sends
   Bob's notifications to the Bubba Bakery UI. The notification for Alice's
   invitation looks like this:

    ```
    {
        "data": [
               {
                   "id": <auto-generated id>,
                   "notification_type": "gameroom_proposal",
                   "org": "",
                   "requester": <Alice's public key>,
                   "node_id": "acme-node-000",
                   "target": "01234-ABCDE",
                   "timestamp": <time entry was created>,
                   "read": <boolean; false means not read>,
               }
        ],
        "paging": {
                   "current": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
                   "offset": 0,
                   "limit": 100,
                   "total": 1,
                   "first": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
                   "prev": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
                   "next": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
                   "last": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0"
        },
    }
    ```

At this point, the Bubba Bakery Gameroom UI has the information it needs to
display Bob's home screen.

### I-4. Behind scene 4: Bob checks his notification

On Bob's Bubba Bakery home screen, the UI displays Bob's existing gamerooms on
the left (none, at this point) and notifications in the upper right (as a bell
icon). Bob's public key is not listed as the requester on the gameroom_proposal
notification, so the Bubba Bakery UI displays the notification icon with a red
badge that indicates an unread notification.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene4_2.png %}
"Bubba Bakery home screen with notification")

1. When Bob clicks the bell icon, the UI shows his unread notifications.

    ![]({% link
    docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene4_1.png %}
    "Bob's notification details")


2. When Bob clicks on his notification, the Bubba Bakery UI calls the Bubba
   Bakery Gameroom REST API to update the selected notification (to show that Bob
   has read it). After the update, this notification will no longer show up as a
   new notification in the UI.

    ```
    PATCH /notifications/{notification_id}/read
    ```

    This call updates the notification’s entry read field in the Bubba Bakery
    database’s gameroom_notification table from false to true. For more
    information on this table, see
    [section I-2.8.5](#i-285-new-gameroom_notification-table-entry).

3. After successfully updating the notification, the Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST
   API responds with the entire notification object.

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": <auto generated id>,
          "notification_type": "gameroom_proposal",
          "requester": <Alice’s public key>,
          “requester_node_id”: “acme-node-000”,
          "target": "01234-ABCDE",
          "timestamp": <time entry was created>,
          "read": true
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### I-5. Behind scene 5: Bob accepts Alice's invitation

When Bob accepts Alice's invitation, the Bubba Bakery UI sends his "yes" vote to
the Gameroom REST API, which forwards it to Splinter REST API. After the vote is
validated, the admin service creates the circuit in Splinter state and tells the
Gameroom daemon that the circuit is available.

Next, the Bubba Bakery admin service notifies the Acme node that it's ready to
create services. After the Acme node responds (described in "Behind Scene 6"),
the Bubba Bakery admin service initializes its scabbard service for the new
gameroom. Scabbard is the Splinter service for Gameroom that includes the
[Sawtooth Sabre](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sabre/sabre_transaction_family.html)
transaction handler and [Hyperledger Transact](https://crates.io/crates/transact),
using two-phase commit consensus to agree on state. Gameroom uses this service
to store the XO smart contract and manage XO state. Finally, the Gameroom daemon
updates the gameroom status in its local database from "Accepted" to "Ready".

#### I-5.1. Bubba Bakery UI submits Accept Invitation request to Gameroom REST API

When Bob clicks on the Accept button, the Bubba Bakery Gameroom UI sends a vote
(also called a "circuit vote request") to the Gameroom REST API.

```
POST /proposals/vote
  {
    "circuit_id": "gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>",
    "circuit_hash": "8cd2bfcf3f4259b9785a723e19b4bb4d5cc0206e",
    "vote": "Accept"
  }
```

#### I-5.2. Gameroom REST API submits Proposal Accept request to Splinter REST API

1. When the Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API receives the vote request, it uses
   that information to create a `CircuitManagementPayload`, which will
   eventually be sent to the Bubba Bakery Splinter daemon.

2. Before the payload can be sent, the Bubba Bakery UI must sign the bytes of
   the `CircuitManagementPayload` header.

    The following example shows a YAML representation of the
    `CircuitManagementPayload` that the Gameroom REST API creates.

    **Circuit proposal vote**:
    ```
    circuit_id: gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>
    circuit_hash:
      <sha256 hash of the circuit definition of the proposed circuit>
    vote: Accept
    ```

    **Header**:
    ```
    Action: CIRCUIT_PROPOSAL_VOTE
    requester: <public key of requester> // left empty by the REST API
    payload_sha512: <sha512 hash of the circuit proposal vote described above>
    requester_id: <ID of the Splinter node that the requester is registered to>
    ```

    **`CircuitManagementPayload`**:
    ```
    header: <bytes of header described above>
    circuit_proposal_vote: <circuit proposal vote described above>
    signature: <signature of bytes of the header> // left empty by the REST API
    ```

    Note that the Gameroom REST API does not fill in the requester field in the
    header or the signature field in the `CircuitManagementPayload`.

3. The Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API serializes the payload and sends the bytes
   as a response to the UI.

    ```
    {
      "data": { “payload_bytes”: <bytes of the CircuitManagementPayload> }
    }
    ```

4. After receiving the response from the Gameroom REST API, the Bubba Bakery UI
   deserializes the `CircuitManagementPayload`. It adds the requester's public
   key to the header (in this case, Alice is the requester), serializes the
   header, signs the header bytes, and adds the signature to the payload.
   Finally, the UI serializes the complete payload.

5. The Bubba Bakery UI submits the bytes of the signed payload to the Gameroom
   REST API.

    ```
    POST /submit
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    <bytes of the signed CircuitManagementPayload>
    ```

6. The Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API forwards the payload to the Bubba Bakery
   Splinter daemon.

    ```
    POST /submit
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    <bytes of the signed CircuitManagementPayload>
    ```

7. The Splinter REST API responds with the status "202 Accepted" and the Bubba
   Bakery admin service processes the vote.

8. The Bubba Bakery REST API forwards the "202 Accepted" response to the Bubba
   Bakery UI.

#### I-5.3. Bubba Bakery node votes "yes" (validates the vote)

1. The Bubba Bakery admin service (`admin::bubba-node-000`) receives the
   `CircuitManagementPayload` containing a `CircuitProposalVote` from the
   Splinter REST API, and adds it to its pending circuit payloads queue.

    ```
    CircuitProposalVote:
    circuit_id: gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>
    circuit_hash: <hash of circuit>
    vote: ACCEPT
    ```

2. The Bubba Bakery admin service validates `CircuitManagementPayload` using the
   same validation process described earlier (see
   [section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload),
   step 1). It also validates the provided payload (a `CircuitProposalVote`)
   using vote-specific validation rules. `CircuitProposalVote` is valid if the
   following things are true:

    * There is a pending `CircuitProposal` in admin state with the same circuit
      ID as in the `CircuitProposalVote`

    * The hash of the stored pending `CircuitProposal` is the same as the
      `circuit_hash` in `CircuitProposalVote`

    * `CircuitProposalVote` vote field is set to either the Vote enum `ACCEPT` or
      `REJECT`

    * The public key belongs to a node in the circuit, and that node is allowed
      to submit the vote (see below).

    * `CircuitProposal` does not already contain a vote from that node.
      To verify the node's public key and voting permission, the admin service
      checks the key registry and key permissions manager.

    * The key registry provides a way to look up details about a public key used
      to sign a circuit proposal: the requester node ID (the "home node" of the
      requester and location of that user's public key) and arbitrary metadata
      (represented as key/value string pairs).

    * The key permissions manager checks that a public key is authorized in a
      specific role. In the case of circuit proposal votes, the signing public
      key must be authorized for the role "voter".

3. If the request is valid, the admin service makes a copy of the existing
   `CircuitProposal`, adds a vote record to it, and stores it in
   `AdminServiceShared.pending_changes`. The protobuf is represented in YAML
   format.

    ```
    CircuitProposal:
      proposal_type: CREATE
      circuit_id: gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>:
      circuit_hash: <hash of circuit>
      circuit_proposal:
        circuit:
          gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>:
            auth: trust
            members:

                endpoints:
                  - tls://splinterd-node-acme:8044
              bubba-node-000:
                endpoints:
                  - tls://splinterd-node-bubba:8044
            roster:
              gameroom_acme-node-000:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - acme-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gameroom_bubba-node-000
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>

              gameroom_bubba-node-000:
                service_type: scabbard
                allowed_nodes:
                  - acme-node-000
                arguments:
                  - peer_services:
                      - gameroom_acme-node-000
                    admin_keys:
                      - <acme gameroomd public key>

            persistence: any
            durability: none
            routes: require_direct
            circuit_management_type: gameroom
      votes:
        - public_key: <voter’s public key>
          vote: ACCEPT
          voter_node_id: bubba-node-000
      requester: <public key of requester>
      requester_node_id: acme-node-000
    ```

4. The admin service creates a new consensus `Proposal` for the updated
   `CircuitProposal`. (See
    [section I-2.5.1](#i-251-acme-node-validates-the-circuitmanagementpayload),
    step 3, for the `Proposal` description.)

#### I-5.4. Bubba Bakery node sends proposal accept vote to Acme node

1. After the Bubba node creates the updated `CircuitProposal`, the
   `CircuitManagementPayload` is sent to the other members defined in the circuit
   -- specifically, the admin service on the Acme node (`admin::acme-node-000`).

2. The Acme admin service receives the `CircuitMangementPayload` containing the
   `CircuitProposalVote` (as described in
   [section I-5.3](#i-53-bubba-bakery-node-votes-yes-validates-the-vote),
   step 1), validates the payload (see
   [section I-5.3](#i-53-bubba-bakery-node-votes-yes-validates-the-vote),
   step 2), and creates an updated `CircuitProposal` (see
   [section I-5.3](#i-53-bubba-bakery-node-votes-yes-validates-the-vote),
   step 3).

3. The nodes use consensus to agree to accept or reject the circuit proposal.
   See [Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus) for more information on consensus
   agreement.

4. After consensus has completed its agreement on the proposal, it notifies the
   Bubba Bakery admin service that both nodes have accepted the proposal. The
   Bubba Bakery admin service then commits the updated `CircuitProposal`.

#### I-5.5. Bubba Bakery admin service checks for approval and creates a circuit

1. When the `CircuitProposal` is committed, the Bubba Bakery admin service checks
   to see if it contains the required number of `ACCEPT` votes to be added to
   Splinter state (the `SplinterState` struct), where active circuits are stored.

   The `CircuitProposal` must have a `VoteRecord` with a vote of `ACCEPT` from
   every member of the proposed circuit definition, except for the requester
   (because submitting a circuit proposal counts as an accept vote).

2. If a vote exists for every member, the Bubba Bakery admin service adds the
   circuit defined in the CircuitProposal to Splinter state. Once in Splinter
   state, the circuit is ready to accept service connections and be used for
   communication.

3. After the circuit has been created, the Bubba Bakery admin service creates
   the scabbard service using the service orchestrator (described in
   [section I-5.8](#i-58-bubba-bakery-admin-service-initializes-scabbard-service)).

#### I-5.6. Bubba Bakery admin service notifies Gameroom daemon of new circuit

1. The Bubba Bakery admin service notifies the Bubba Bakery application
   authorization handler that the circuit has been accepted.
    ```

        }],
        “requester”: “<public key of requester>”
        “requester_node_id”: “acme-node-000”
      }
    }
    ```

2. When the application authorization handler receives this message, it updates
   the database to change the status of the proposal, gameroom, members and
   services from “Pending” to “Accepted”.

   At the end of the database transaction, the gameroom database has the
   following updates:

        <td>Create</td>
        <td>&lt;hash of circuit definition&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

3. Finally, the application authorization handler updates the
   `gameroom_notification` table to tell the UI that the gameroom proposal has
   been accepted.

   <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">

#### I-5.7. Bubba Bakery admin service sends "ready to create services" to Acme

Before the Bubba Bakery admin service can initialize its scabbard service on the
new circuit, it needs to know that the Acme Splinter node has also created the
circuit on the Acme side (added the circuit that is defined in the
`CircuitProposal` to Splinter state). The Acme process will be described in the
next chapter (section I-6).

This information is required because when a Splinter service connects to its own
Splinter node (the node that it is allowed to connect to), that Splinter node
sends a message to the other connected Splinter nodes on the new circuit that
the service is available. This message cannot be sent until the Splinter node
(in this case, the Acme node) has created the circuit.

If the circuit was not yet created on the other Splinter node (or nodes), the
message would be dropped. This node would not be able to communicate with the
other node's service after the circuit is created, because it wouldn't know
where that service exists.

1. To notify the Acme admin service that the Bubba Bakery node is ready to
   initialize its service, the Bubba Bakery admin service sends an `AdminMessage`
   with the message type `MEMBER_READY` and a "member ready" message that
   contains the circuit ID and Bubba Bakery's node ID.

    ```
    admin_message:
    message_type: MEMBER_READY,
    member_ready:
      circuit_id: gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>
      member_node_id: bubba-node-000
    ```

2. The Bubba Bakery admin service waits for Acme to respond with a "member
   ready" message. (The next section describes how the Bubba Bakery node
   initializes its services.)

#### I-5.8. Bubba Bakery admin service initializes scabbard service

After the circuit is created (described in
[section I-5.5](#i-55-bubba-bakery-admin-service-checks-for-approval-and-creates-a-circuit))
and all members are ready to create services (covered in
[section I-5.7](#i-57-bubba-bakery-admin-service-sends-ready-to-create-services-to-acme)),
the Bubba Bakery admin service makes a call to the service orchestrator to
initialize the scabbard service for the new gameroom. As described above,
scabbard is the Splinter service for Gameroom that includes the
[Sawtooth Sabre](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sabre/sabre_transaction_family.html)
transaction handler and [Hyperledger Transact](https://crates.io/crates/transact),
using two-phase commit consensus to agree on state. Gameroom uses this service
to store the XO smart contract and manage XO state.

1. The Bubba Bakery admin service checks which services are allowed to run on
   its node. In this case, the Bubba Bakery node (`bubba-node-000`) is allowed to
   run the scabbard service with service ID `gameroom_bubba-node-000`.

2. The admin service creates a ServiceDefinition for `gameroom_bubba-node-000`,
   which is the scabbard service on the Bubba Bakery Splinter node.

    ```
    ServiceDefinition {
      circuit: "gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>",
      service_id: "gameroom_bubba-node-000",
      service_type: "scabbard",
    }
    ```

3. The admin service passes the service definition, along with the arguments
   defined in the `CircuitProposal` for that service, to the service
   orchestrator’s `initialize_service` method to initialize the scabbard service.

4. `ServiceOrchestrator` uses structs that implement the `ServiceFactory` trait
   to create new services. An orchestrator can have multiple factories. First,
   the orchestrator must determine which factory can create a scabbard service
   (in this case, the `ScabbardFactory`). Then the orchestrator creates a new
   instance of the scabbard service using that factory, the service definition,
   and the service arguments.

5. After the scabbard service has been created, the orchestrator starts the
   service and adds it to its internally managed list of services. When starting
   the service, the orchestrator creates a `StandardServiceNetworkRegistry`
   (used to register the service with the node) and passes it to the service;
   the scabbard service then registers, which provides it with a
   `StandardServiceNetworkSender` that it will use to send direct messages to
   other services.

#### I-5.9. Bubba Bakery Gameroom daemon updates gameroom status in database

At this point, the new service is running and ready to receive smart contracts.

1. The Bubba Bakery admin service sends a `CircuitReady` notification to the
   Gameroom daemon's application authorization handler to let it know that the
   circuit is created and its services are ready.

    ```
    {
      “eventType”: "CircuitReady",
      “message”: {
        “proposal_type”: “Create”,
        “circuit_id”: “gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>”,
        “circuit_hash”: “...”,
        “circuit”: {
          "circuit_id": "gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>",
          "authorization_type": "Trust",
          "members": [{
            "node_id": "acme-node-000",
            "endpoint": "tls://splinterd-node-acme:8044"
            },
            {
            "node_id": "bubba-node-000",
            "endpoint": "tls://splinterd-node-bubba:8044"
            }
          ],
          "roster": [{
            "service_id": "gameroom_acme-node-000",
            "service_type": "scabbard",
            "allowed_nodes": [ "acme-node-000"]
            "arguments": {
                "peer_services": [ "gameroom_bubba-node-000" ]
                "admin_keys": [ "<acme gameroomd public key>" ]
              }
            },
            {
            "service_id": "gameroom_bubba-node-000",
            "service_type": "scabbard",
            "allowed_nodes": [ "bubba-node-000"]
            "arguments": {
                "peer_services": [ "gameroom_acme-node-000" ]
                "admin_keys": [ "<acme gameroomd public key>" ]
              }
            }
          ],
          "circuit_management_type": "gameroom",
          "application_metadata": [...],
          "persistence": "Any",
          "durability": "None",
          "routes": "Any"
        },
        “vote_record”: [{
          “public_key”: “<public key of voter>”,
          “vote”: “Accepted”
          "voter_node_id": “bubba-node-000”
        }],
        “requester”: “<public key of requester>”
        “requester_node_id”: “acme-node-000”
      }
    }
    ```

2. When the authorization handler receives the `CircuitReady` message, it
   changes the status of the gameroom in the database from “Accepted” to “Ready”.

3. The authorization handler creates a new `WebSocket` to listen for events from
   the scabbard service. These events are then captured, parsed, and uploaded
   into the gameroom database. The process of reading state-change updates from
   Splinter and uploading them to a local database is called "state delta export"
   and is done by the `XoStateDeltaProcessor`. The `XoStateDeltaProcessor`
   consumes `StateChangeEvent` payloads, such as this example:
    ```
    {
      “type”: “Set”,
      “message”: {
        “key”: “<xo_address>”
        “value” [<bytes>]
      }
    }
    ```

    The bytes in value field are deserialized into the following CSV-format
    representation of the XO game state:

    `“<game-name>,<game-board>,<game-state>,<player1-key>,<player2-key>”`

    For more information on the XO game state, see
    [Appendix D](#appendix-d-xo-smart-contract-specification).

At this point, the circuit (Alice and Bob's gameroom) is ready. Next, the Acme
Gameroom daemon must submit the XO smart contract, which is the last step before
the gameroom is ready for Alice and Bob to play games. See
[section Ⅰ-6.6](#i-66-acme-gameroom-daemon-submits-sabre-transactions-to-add-xo-smart-contract)
for an explanation of this process.

### I-6. Behind scene 6: Bob accepts Alice's invitation

Most of the steps in this scene are similar to the Bubba Bakery steps described
earlier. However, one activity is unique — because the Acme node (Alice's node)
requested the new circuit, it is responsible for submitting the XO smart
contract that will allow Alice and Bob to play tic tac toe in the new gameroom.

#### Ⅰ-6.1. Acme admin service receives `CircuitProposalVote` from Bubba Bakery

When the Acme Splinter node receives the `CircuitManagementPayload` network
message containing the Bubba Bakery `CircuitProposalVote` (sent in
[section 5.4](#i-54-bubba-bakery-node-sends-proposal-accept-vote-to-acme-node)),
it "unwraps" the message with a series of dispatchers. See
[section 2.7](#i-27-admin-services-notify-authorization-handler-of-pending-circuit-proposal)
for the details of this process.

As described in [section 5.4](#i-54-bubba-bakery-node-sends-proposal-accept-vote-to-acme-node),
step 3, both nodes use consensus to agree on the circuit proposal, After they
agree, the Acme node commits the CircuitProposal.

#### Ⅰ-6.2 Acme admin service checks for approval and creates circuit

When the CircuitProposal is committed, the Acme admin service checks that the
Bubba Bakery node has voted "yes" (see
[section 5.3](#i-53-bubba-bakery-node-votes-yes-validates-the-vote),
then creates the circuit (adds the new circuit to Splinter state). For the
details of this process, see
[section I-5.5](#i-55-bubba-bakery-admin-service-checks-for-approval-and-creates-a-circuit).

#### Ⅰ-6.3. Acme admin service notifies Acme Gameroom daemon of new circuit

Once the circuit has been created, the Acme admin service tells the Acme
application authorization handler that the circuit has been accepted. When the
application authorization handler receives this message, it updates the
database to change the status of the proposal, gameroom, members and services
from “Pending” to “Accepted”. See [section I-5.6](#i-56-bubba-bakery-admin-service-notifies-gameroom-daemon-of-new-circuit)
for the details of this process.

#### Ⅰ-6.4. Acme admin service tells Bubba Bakery that it is ready to create services

The Acme node notifies the Bubba Bakery node that it is ready to initialize the
Acme scabbard service by sending an an `AdminMessage` with the message type
`MEMBER_READY` and a "member ready" message that contains the circuit ID and
Acme's Splinter node ID.

The Acme node waits for all members to report a "member ready" message before
proceeding. For the details, see [section I-5.7](#i-57-bubba-bakery-admin-service-sends-ready-to-create-services-to-acme).

#### Ⅰ-6.5. Acme admin service creates scabbard service via service orchestration

After the Acme node learns that all members are ready to create services, the
Acme admin service makes a call to the service orchestrator to initialize the
scabbard service for the new gameroom. See [section I-5.8](#i-58-bubba-bakery-admin-service-initializes-scabbard-service)
for the details of this process.

#### Ⅰ-6.6. Acme Gameroom daemon submits Sabre transactions to add XO smart contract

The Acme Gameroom daemon submits the XO smart contract by using the scabbard
REST API that is exposed by the Splinter daemon, `splinterd`.

When the Acme Gameroom daemon’s application authorization handler receives the
`CircuitReady` notification from the admin service, it subscribes to scabbard
and starts listening for scabbard events. See
[Appendix C](#appendix-c-circuit-proposal-events) for the registration
(event subscription) process.

```
GET <circuit_id>/<service_id>/ws/subscribe
```

After a connection has been established, the application authorization handler
prepares the XO (tic tac toe) business logic by submitting the XO smart
contract to the Acme scabbard service.

The Acme gameroom daemon gets the following information from the
`CircuitProposal` that was just accepted (as described in
[section I-5.9](#i-59-bubba-bakery-gameroom-daemon-updates-gameroom-status-in-database)):

`circuit_id`: unique ID of the new circuit that includes a version 4 UUID, such
as `gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>`

`service_id`: ID of the scabbard service that is running on the local Splinter
node; for example: `gameroom_acme-node-000`

`scabbard_admin_keys`: scabbard admin keys that are stored in the circuit
proposal’s application metadata

The scabbard admin keys in Gameroom’s application metadata specify who is
allowed to add or modify smart contracts. When the circuit is initially defined
(see [section I-2.3](#i-23-gameroom-rest-api-sends-a-circuitmanagementpayload)),
the Gameroom daemon that creates the circuit definition (in this case, Acme's
`gameroomd`) specifies its own public key as the scabbard admin. Since the Acme
Gameroom daemon has the only key that’s authorized to add smart contracts, it
is responsible for adding the XO smart contract.

To add the XO smart contract, the Acme Gameroom daemon creates a series of
transactions to set the permissions surrounding the smart contract and to
submit the smart contract itself. For more information, see the
[Sawtooth Sabre](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sabre/sabre_transaction_family.html)
documentation.

The Acme Gameroom daemon bundles these transactions into a batch, serializes
the batch, and submits the serialized batch to the scabbard service on its
local Splinter node:

```
	POST /scabbard/<circuit_id>/<service_id>/batches
  <serialized batch>
```

For more information about batches, see "Transactions and Batches" in the
[Sawtooth Architecture](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html)
documentation.

When the Acme scabbard service receives this batch, it must agree with the
Bubba Bakery scabbard service to submit the smart contract. The Acme scabbard
service performs the following steps:

a. Deserializes the batch: Shares the batch with the other scabbard services in
   the circuit (in this case, the Bubba Bakery scabbard service)

b. Creates a consensus proposal to send to the admin services of the other
   nodes (in this case, Bubba Bakery's scabbard service) to agree on the batch

c. Waits for consensus to agree on the batch, then commits it to scabbard
   state. For information on consensus, see [Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus).

d. After the scabbard services on both nodes have committed the smart contract,
   the Acme Splinter node is done setting up the gameroom.

#### Ⅰ-6.7. Both Gameroom daemons update gameroom status in database

The application authorization handler listens for scabbard events using its
state delta processor, `XoStateDeltaProcessor`. When the state delta processor
receives an event with the address of the uploaded XO contract it then sets the
status of the gameroom to “circuit_active”

```
StateChangeEvent containing contact address
{
  “type”: “Set”,
  “message”: {
    “key”: “<xo_contract_address>”
    “value” [..]
  }
}
```

At this point, the state delta processor will begin listening for
XO game state changes (defined in
[Appendix D](#appendix-d-xo-smart-contract-specification)).

#### Ⅰ-6.8. Acme Gameroom daemon notifies Acme UI

After the state delta processor sets the status of the gameroom to
“circuit_active”, the Acme Gameroom application authorization handler adds a
new entry to the `gameroom_notification` table:


<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>id</th>
    <th>notification_type</th>
    <th>requester</th>
    <th>requester_node_id</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
    <td>gameroom_proposal</td>
    <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
    <td>acme-node-000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>target</th>
    <th>created_time</th>
    <th>read</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
    <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
    <td>f</td>
  </tr>
</table>


This notification is pushed to the Acme UI in the same way as the
“gameroom_proposal” notification. (See [section I-2.8.4](#i-284-new-gameroom-proposal-table-entry))

#### Ⅰ-6.9. Alice sees notification that new gameroom is ready

After the notification is pushed to the Acme UI, Alice sees a new notification.
The new gameroom also appears on the dashboard menu.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/scene6_3.png %}
"Acme gameroom homescreen")

When Alice clicks on the notification, she sees the details page for the new
gameroom. (See [Behind Scene 4, Bob Checks his Notifications](#i-4-behind-scene-4-bob-checks-his-notification))

## Act II: Alice and Bob Play XO

### Scene 1: Alice creates a new XO game

Alice returns from lunch and unlocks her computer. The GAMEROOM TAB is still
displayed.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene1_1.png %}
"Gameroom tab"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Alice wants to play an XO game. She clicks **New Game**. Alice sees the NEW GAME
DIALOG.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene1_2.png %}
"New game modal")

Alice enters **“alice_vs_bob”** as the game name. She clicks the SEND BUTTON.

The Gameroom application starts creating the game. Alice sees a new
`alice_vs_bob` entry with a SPINNER and the message **"CREATING GAME"**.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene1_3.png %}
"Creating Acme + Bubba game"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

A short period of time passes. When the game has been fully created, Alice sees
a blank game board and the message **"JOIN GAME"**.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene1_4.png %}
"Join Acme + Bubba game"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Scene 2: Alice makes the first move

Alice clicks JOIN GAME on the newly created game. The `alice_vs_bob`
game board appears.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene2_1.png %}
"'alice_vs_bob' game board"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Alice stretches her hands and rubs her neck, preparing for her first move.

She clicks the center spot on the board.

While the Gameroom application processes her move, Alice sees a spinner in the
center spot.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene2_2.png %}
"Alice's move processing the game board"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Time passes. The spinner disappears and an `X` appears in its place. Alice's
first move has been accepted.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene2_3.png %}
"Alice's move on the game board"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Now she must wait for Bob’s first move.

### Scene 3: Bob takes a turn

Eventually, Bob sees a RED NUMBER 1 on his bell icon, which means that he has a
notification.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene3_1.png %}
"Bob's new game notification"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Bob clicks on the bell icon. He sees that the game `alice_vs_bob` is available
in the `Acme + Bubba` gameroom.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene3_2.png %}
"Bob's notification details"){:height="35%" width="35%"}

He clicks on the notification text. The `alice_vs_bob` game board is displayed.

Bob sees that Alice has taken the center space.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene3_3.png %}
"Bob's decision"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Muttering to himself, Bob makes his first move: he takes the top right corner.

While the Gameroom application processes his move, Bob sees a spinner in that
space.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene3_4.png %}
"Bob's move processing on the game board"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Soon, the spinner disappears. Bob's first move has been accepted.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene3_5.png %}
"Bob's move on the game board"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

The game continues, slowly, as Alice and Bob carefully analyze each move.

### Scene 4: Alice wins the game

It's the last move of the game.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene4_1.png %}
"The final move may be taken"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Alice is biting her nails. Bob wipes his forehead.

Alice clicks on the winning spot. Suspense builds while she watches the spinner.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene4_2.png %}
"Alice makes her move"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

The spinner disappears. Alice wins the game!

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene4_3.png %}
"Alice wins the game"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Bob sees Alice's winning move as a row of red Xs.

![]({% link
  docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act2_scene4_4.png %}
"Bob loses the game"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Scene 5: The triumph of Alice

In Alice's office, we hear CHEERS IN THE BACKGROUND.

Alice turns around and sees a crowd of co-workers who are celebrating her win.

### Scene 6: The tragedy of Bob

In Bob's office, there's a loud crash, then a scream. CUT TO BLACK.

## Behind the Scenes: A Look at Act II, Alice and Bob Play XO

This section describes what really happens during Act II. Although the actions
of creating a game and making moves are different, the underlying functions are
similar to the process of creating a gameroom.

### II-1. Behind scene 1: Alice creates a new XO game

In Scene 1, Alice uses the Gameroom UI to create a new game named
`alice_vs_bob` in the `Acme + Bubba` gameroom. This section explains how the
new game request is handled.

#### II-1.1. Acme client sends ‘create game’ request to Gameroom REST API

1. When Alice clicks `Create` in the New Game screen, the Acme client creates an
   XO transaction request payload for the creation request. (See
   [Appendix D.2](#appendix-d2-xo-transaction-payload) for information about
   the XO transaction request format.)

    ```
    alice_vs_bob,create,
    ```

2. The Acme client wraps this transaction request payload in a `sabre_payload`
   message.

    ```
    ---
    sabre_payload:
     action: "EXECUTE_CONTRACT"
     execute_contract:
       name: xo
       version: 0.3.3
       inputs:
         - 5b7349
         - 00ec00
         - 00ec01
         - 00ec02
       outputs:
         - 5b7349
       payload: b"alice_vs_bob,create,"
    ```

3. The Acme client bundles the Sabre payload into a batch, then serializes the
   batch into an array of bytes. (For more information, see "Transactions and
   Batches" in the
   [Sawtooth Architecture](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html)
   documentation.)

4. The Acme client sends the batch to the Acme Gameroom REST API.

    ```
    POST /gamerooms/<circuid_id>/batches
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    <bytes of the batch containing the Sabre XO transaction>
    ```

5. After the transaction is sent, the Acme Gameroom UI displays a spinner and
   the message "Creating Game", which shows that the game is in a pending state.

      docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene1_1.png %}
    "Pending new game")

     This state continues until the UI is notified that the new game has been
     committed to state (described in
     [section II-1.6](#ii-16-gameroom-rest-apis-tell-clients-that-xo-game-is-committed)).

#### II-1.2. Acme Gameroom REST API sends ‘create' transaction to Acme scabbard service

The Acme gameroom daemon passes the serialized batch (which contains the XO
transaction) to the Acme scabbard service, using the scabbard service's
existing REST API route (as described in
[section Ⅰ-6.6](#i-66-acme-gameroom-daemon-submits-sabre-transactions-to-add-xo-smart-contract),
step 4).

```
POST /scabbard/<circuit_id>/<service_id>/batches
<serialized batch>
```

#### II-1.3. Scabbard services use consensus to commit the new game

When the Acme scabbard service receives this batch, it commits the batch using
a similar process as adding the XO smart contract (described in
[section Ⅰ-6.6](#i-66-acme-gameroom-daemon-submits-sabre-transactions-to-add-xo-smart-contract),
step 5).

1. The first steps are the same: The Acme scabbard service deserializes the
   batch, then shares the batch with the Bubba Bakery scabbard service  so that
   both nodes can use consensus to agree to commit the new game.

2. Next, the scabbard services use the Sabre transaction handler to use the XO
   smart contract to execute the transactions in the batch.

3. The remaining steps are the same as before: After the nodes agree on state
   using two-phase commit consensus, both scabbard services commit the new XO
   game to scabbard state in their local database.

#### II-1.4. Scabbard services use consensus to commit the new game

After the new XO game has been committed to scabbard state, both scabbard
services send the new XO game state to their gameroom daemon via a WebSocket
connection.

An XO game state is defined as a string of comma-separated values:

```
“<game-name>,<board-state>,<game-state>,<player1-key>,<player2-key>”
```

The message to the gameroom daemon looks like this:

```
{
    “eventType”: “Set”,
    “message”: {
      “key”: “<xo game address>”,
      “value”: b“alice_vs_bob,---------,P1-NEXT,,”
      }
}
```

Note that the values for `<player1-key>` and `<player2-key>` are empty. These
fields are not set until a player makes the first move. (This is a design
choice for the XO smart contract; it's not an inherent limitation of Splinter
or the Gameroom application.)

#### II-1.5. Gameroom daemons update gameroom status in database

When a Gameroom daemon receives the message from its scabbard service, the
daemon stores the state change in its local database.

1. Because this is a new game, the Gameroom daemon creates a new entry in the
   `xo_games` table in the database.

   The `xo_games` table has this definition:

   ``` sql
   xo_games (
     id                    	BIGSERIAL   	PRIMARY KEY,
     circuit_id            	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     game_name             	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     player_1              	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     player_2              	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     game_status           	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     game_board            	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
     created_time          	TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
     updated_time          	TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
     FOREIGN KEY (circuit_id) REFERENCES gameroom(circuit_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

   At the end of this operation, the `xo_games` table has the following entry:

   <table class="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>id</th>
       <th>circuit_id</th>
       <th>game_name</th>
       <th>player_1</th>
       <th>player_2</th>
     </tr>
     <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
       <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
       <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
       <td>alice_vs_bob</td>
       <td></td>
       <td></td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <table class="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>game_status</th>
       <th>game_board</th>
       <th>created_time</th>
       <th>updated_time</th>
     </tr>
     <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
       <td>P1-NEXT</td>
       <td>---------</td>
       <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
       <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

2. The gameroom daemon also adds a new notification to the
   `gameroom_notification` table, which indicates that a new game was created.

   <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>id</th>
       <th>notification_type</th>
       <th>requester</th>
       <th>requester_node_id</th>
     </tr>
     <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
       <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
       <td>new_game_created:alice_vs_bob</td>
       <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
       <td>acme-node-000</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>target</th>
       <th>created_time</th>
       <th>read</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
       <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
       <td>f</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

#### II-1.6. Gameroom REST APIs tell clients that XO game is committed

1. After the Acme and Bubba Bakery Gameroom daemons fill in the
  `gameroom_notification` tables, the Gameroom REST API uses a WebSocket
  connection to tell each UI about the new notification.

    ```
    {
      "namespace": "notifications",
      "action": "listNotifications"
    }
    ```

2. When the UI receives that message, it sends a request to the Gameroom REST
   API to fetch a list of unread notifications from the database tables.

    ```
    GET /notifications
    ```

3. The Gameroom REST API responds with the list of unread notifications.

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": <auto generated id>,
          "notification_type": "new_game_created:alice_vs_bob",
          "requester": <Alice’s public key>,
          “node_id”: “acme-node-000”,
              "target": "gameroom::acme-node-000::bubba-node-000::<UUIDv4>",
              "timestamp": <time entry was created>,
              "read": false
        }
      ],
      "paging": {
        "current": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 1,
        "first": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "api/notifications?limit=100&offset=0"
      }
    }
    ```

4. Once the UI receives this notification, it asks the Gameroom REST API to
   fetch the list of games in the `Acme + Bubba` gameroom.

    ```
    GET /xo/01234-ABCDE/games
    ```

5. The Gameroom REST API responds with a list of games that includes the status
   of each game. At this point, only the new `alice_vs_bob` game exists; no
   moves have been made.

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        {
        "circuit_id": "01234-ABCDE",
        "game_name": "alice_vs_bob",
        "player_1": "",
        "player_2": "",
        "game_status": "P1-NEXT",
        "game_board": "---------",
        "created_time": <time entry was created>,
        "updated_time": <time entry was created>
        }
      ],
      "paging": {
        "current": "api/xo/01234-ABCDE/games?limit=100&offset=0",
        "offset": 0,
        "limit": 100,
        "total": 0,
        "first": "api/xo/01234-ABCDE/games?limit=100&offset=0",
        "prev": "api/xo/01234-ABCDE/games?limit=100&offset=0",
        "next": "api/xo/01234-ABCDE/games?limit=100&offset=0",
        "last": "api/xo/01234-ABCDE/games?limit=100&offset=0"
        }
      }
    ```

6. The Acme Gameroom UI checks that the `alice_vs_bob` game is present in the
   list of games received from the REST API.  Because the game is in the list,
   the UI can now show the game in a "committed" state (ready to play because
   the "create game" transaction has been committed).

7. The Acme Gameroom UI replaces the spinner with a blank game board.

    ![]({% link
    docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene1_2.png %}
    "Blank game board")

    Alice can now click on the game board to start playing XO.

### II-2. Behind scene 2: Alice makes the first move

Each game move is handled the same way as the "create game" process described
in [section II-1](#ii-1-behind-scene-1-alice-creates-a-new-xo-game). This
section summarizes these steps.

1. The Acme client submits the "take a space" transaction.

    a. When Alice clicks the middle square in the XO board, the Acme client
         creates an XO transaction request payload for taking the 5th
         space. See [Appendix D.2](#appendix-d2-xo-transaction-payload)
         for information on XO game moves and the game board.

          ```
          alice_vs_bob,take,5,
          ```

    b. As with game creation, the Acme client wraps this transaction request
       payload in a `sabre_payload` message (see [section II-1.1](#ii-11-acme-client-sends-create-game-request-to-gameroom-rest-api),
       step 2 for the message details).

    c. The Acme client bundles the Sabre payload into a batch, then
       serializes the batch into an array of bytes. (For more information,
       see "Transactions and Batches" in the
       [Sawtooth Architecture](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html)
       documentation.)

    d. The Acme client posts the batch to the Acme Gameroom REST API (see
       the details in [section II-1.1](#ii-11-acme-client-sends-create-game-request-to-gameroom-rest-api),
       step 4).

    e. After the transaction is sent, the Acme Gameroom UI displays a
       spinner in the center square until it is notified that the game has
       been updated in state.

      ![]({% link
      docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene2_1.png %}
      "Updating game board square"){:height="35%" width="35%"}

2. The Acme Gameroom REST API forwards the XO `take` transaction to the
   scabbard service (see the details in
   [section II-1.2](#ii-12-acme-gameroom-rest-api-sends-create-transaction-to-acme-scabbard-service)).

3. The Acme and Bubba Bakery scabbard services use consensus (defined in
   [Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus)) to commit the move (as described in
   [section II-1.3](#ii-13-scabbard-services-use-consensus-to-commit-the-new-game)).

4. After Alice's first move has been committed to scabbard state, the scabbard
   services send the new state to their gameroom daemons via a WebSocket
   connection (as described in
   [section II-1.4](#ii-14-scabbard-services-use-consensus-to-commit-the-new-game)).

    This message includes an updated game board that has Alice's `X` in the
    center square of the game board and Alice's public key in the `player1`
    field.

    ```
    {
      “eventType”: “Set”,
      “message”: {
        “key”: “<xo game address>”,
        “value”: b“alice_vs_bob,----x----,P2-NEXT,<Alice’s public key>,”
        }
    }
    ```

    Note that the last field (the key for `player2`) is empty. That field
    will be set when Bob makes his first move.

5. When each Gameroom daemon receives the message, it updates the
   `alice_vs_bob` entry in the `xo_games` table in the database (this entry was
   created in
   [section II-1.5](#ii-15-gameroom-daemons-update-gameroom-status-in-database)).

    At the end of the operation, the `xo_games` table looks like this:

    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>id</th>
        <th>circuit_id</th>
        <th>game_name</th>
        <th>player_1</th>
        <th>player_2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
        <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
        <td>alice_vs_bob</td>
        <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>game_status</th>
        <th>game_board</th>
        <th>created_time</th>
        <th>updated_time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>P2-NEXT</td>
        <td>----X----</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    The gameroom daemon also adds a new notification to the
    `gameroom_notification` table to indicate that the game was updated.

    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>id</th>
        <th>notification_type</th>
        <th>requester</th>
        <th>requester_node_id</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
        <td>game_updated:alice_vs_bob</td>
        <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
        <td>acme-node-000</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>target</th>
        <th>created_time</th>
        <th>read</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
        <td>f</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

6. The Gameroom REST APIs tell the clients that Alice's move has been committed
   and the XO game state has been updated. This process is the same as in
   [section II-1.6](#ii-16-gameroom-rest-apis-tell-clients-that-xo-game-is-committed),
   but the notification details contain information about Alice's move.

    a. After the Acme Gameroom daemon handler fills in the
       `gameroom_notification` table, the Acme Gameroom REST API uses a
       WebSocket connection to tell the Acme UI about the new notification
       (see the details in [section II-1.6](#ii-16-gameroom-rest-apis-tell-clients-that-xo-game-is-committed),
       step 1).

    b. When the Acme UI receives that message, it asks the Gameroom REST
       API to fetch a list of unread notifications from the database tables
       (using the  same `GET /notifications` request as in
       [section II-1.6](#ii-16-gameroom-rest-apis-tell-clients-that-xo-game-is-committed),
       step 2).

    c. The Acme Gameroom REST API responds with the list of unread
       notifications, as described in
       [section II-1.6](#ii-16-gameroom-rest-apis-tell-clients-that-xo-game-is-committed),
       step 3. At this point, however, the notification type is
       `game_updated`.


      ```
      {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": <auto generated id>,
            "notification_type": "game_updated:alice_vs_bob",
            "requester": <Alice’s public key>,
            “node_id”: “acme-node-000”,
            "target": "01234-ABCDE",
            "timestamp": <time entry was created>,
            "read": false
          }
        ],
        "paging": {
        … [SNIP] …
        }
      }
      ```

      d. Once the UI receives this notification, it sends a request to the
         Acme Gameroom REST API to fetch the list of games in the
         `Acme + Bubba` gameroom (using the same GET request as in
         [section Ⅰ-6.6](#i-66-acme-gameroom-daemon-submits-sabre-transactions-to-add-xo-smart-contract),
         step 4).

      e. The Acme Gameroom REST API returns the list of games and game data.
         At this point, the alice_vs_bob game data shows that Alice is
         `player_1`,  `player_2` must move next, and Alice's `X` is in the
         center square of the game board.

      ```
      {
        "data": [
          {
            "circuit_id": "01234-ABCDE",
            "game_name": "alice_vs_bob",
            "player_1": "<Alice’s public key>",
            "player_2": "",
            "game_status": "P2-NEXT",
            "game_board": "----x----",
            "created_time": <time entry was created>,
            "updated_time": <time entry was updated>
          }
        ],
        "paging": {
        … [SNIP] …
        }
      }
      ```

    f. The Acme Gameroom UI now shows that Alice’s move has been committed
       by replacing the spinner in the center square with a red X.

     ![]({% link
     docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene2_2.png %}
     "Red `X` front and center"){:height="35%" width="35%"}

### II-3. Behind scene 3: Bob takes a turn

In Act II, Scene 3, Bob notices his "new game" notification, clicks on it, and
is redirected to the game page. The notification process is the same as in Act
Ⅰ, section Ⅰ-3, when Bob saw Alice's invitation for the new gameroom. When Bob
joins the game, the process is similar to Alice's first move in Act II, section
II-2. This section summarizes the process and highlights the differences.

1. The Bubba Bakery client gets a notification of a new game in the Acme +
   Bubba gameroom (see the details in [section I-3.6](#i-36-bubba-bakery-ui-requests-list-of-gameroom-invitations))

2. Bob checks his notifications as described in
   [section Ⅰ-4](#i-4-behind-scene-4-bob-checks-his-notification).

3. When Bob clicks on his "alice_vs_bob" game notification, he joins the XO
   game with Alice.

    a. The Bubba Bakery UI makes a call to the Gameroom REST API for the list of
       existing games in the Acme + Bubba gameroom.

      ```
      GET /xo/<circuitID>/games
      ```

    b. The Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API responds with a list of games. The
       game data shows the status after Alice's first move, as described in
       [section II-2](#ii-2-behind-scene-2-alice-makes-the-first-move), step 6e.

      ```
      {
        "data": [
          {
            "circuit_id": "01234-ABCDE",
            "game_name": "alice_vs_bob",
            "player_1": "<Alice’s public key>",
            "player_2": "",
            "game_status": "P2-NEXT",
            "game_board": "----x----",
            "created_time": <time entry was created>,
            "updated_time": <time entry was updated>
          }
        ],
        "paging": {
        … [SNIP] …
        }
      }
      ```

    c. The Bubba Bakery UI then displays the game board and related information
       for the `alice_vs_bob` game. Bob sees Alice's `X` in the center square.

      ![]({% link
      docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene3_1.png %}
      "Alice's move")

4. When Bob clicks the top right square on the XO board, the Bubba Bakery
   client starts the process of handling his "take a square" request.

    a. The Bubba Bakery client creates an XO transaction request payload for
       taking the 3rd square.

      ```
      alice_vs_bob,take,3
      ```

    b. The Bubba Bakery client wraps this transaction request payload in a
       `sabre_payload` message (as described in section [section II-1.1](#ii-11-acme-client-sends-create-game-request-to-gameroom-rest-api),
       step 2), bundles the Sabre payload into a batch and serializes it (see
       [section II-1.1](#ii-11-acme-client-sends-create-game-request-to-gameroom-rest-api),
       step 3), then posts it to the Bubba Bakery Gameroom REST API (see
       [section II-1.1](#ii-11-acme-client-sends-create-game-request-to-gameroom-rest-api),
       step 4).

       After the transaction is sent, the Bubba Gameroom UI displays a spinner
       until it is notified that the game has been updated in state.

       ![]({% link

       "Updating game board square"){:height="35%" width="35%"}

5. The Bubba Bakery REST API forwards the XO ‘take’ transaction to the scabbard
   service (see the details in [section II-1.2](#ii-12-acme-gameroom-rest-api-sends-create-transaction-to-acme-scabbard-service)).

6. The Bubba Bakery and Acme scabbard services use consensus (defined in
   [Appendix B](#appendix-b-consensus)) to commit the move, as described in
    [section II-1.3](#ii-13-scabbard-services-use-consensus-to-commit-the-new-game).
   For Bob's move, Bubba Bakery's scabbard service starts the process.

7. After Bob's move has been committed to scabbard state, the scabbard services
   send the new state to the gameroom daemon via a WebSocket connection (as
   described in [section II-1.4](#ii-14-scabbard-services-use-consensus-to-commit-the-new-game)).

    This message includes an updated game board that has Bob's `O` in the top
    right square (3rd space) of the game board and Bob's public key in the
    `player_2` field.

    ```
    {
      “eventType”: “Set”,
      “message”: {
        “key”: “<xo game address>”,
        “value”: b“alice_vs_bob,--o-x----,P2-NEXT,<Alice’s public key>,<Bob’s public key>”
      }
    }
    ```

8. When each Gameroom daemon receives the message, it updates the `alice_vs_bob`
   entry in the `xo_games` table in the database (this entry was created in
   [section II-1.5](#ii-15-gameroom-daemons-update-gameroom-status-in-database)).

    At the end of the operation, the `xo_games` table looks like this:

    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>id</th>
        <th>circuit_id</th>
        <th>game_name</th>
        <th>player_1</th>
        <th>player_2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
        <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
        <td>alice_vs_bob</td>
        <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
        <td>&lt;Bob's public key&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>game_status</th>
        <th>game_board</th>
        <th>created_time</th>
        <th>updated_time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>P1-NEXT</td>
        <td>--O-X----</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    As with Alice's first move, the gameroom daemon also adds a "game updated"
    notification to the `gameroom_notification` table (see
    [section II-2](#ii-2-behind-scene-2-alice-makes-the-first-move), step 5).

9. The Gameroom REST APIs notify the Gameroom daemons that the XO game’s state
   has been updated. This process is the same as for Alice's first move (see
   [section II-2](#ii-2-behind-scene-2-alice-makes-the-first-move),
   step 6), but the notification details contain information about Bob's move.

    When the Gameroom REST APIs return the list of games and game data, the
    `alice_vs_bob` game data shows that Bob is `player_2`, Alice has the next
    move, and each player has made one move on the game board.

      ```
      {
         "data": [
              {
                 "circuit_id": "01234-ABCDE",
                 "game_name": "alice_vs_bob",
                 "player_1": "<Alice’s public key>",
                 "player_2": "<Bob’s public key>",
                 "game_status": "P1-NEXT",
                 "game_board": "--o-x----",
                 "created_time": <time entry was created>,
                 "updated_time": <time entry was updated>
             }
         ],
         "paging": {
           … [SNIP] …
         }
      }
      ```

10. The Bubba Bakery UI now shows that Bob's move has been committed by
    replacing the spinner in the upper right corner with a blue `O`.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/bts_act2_scene3_3.png %}
"Bob's move"){:height="35%" width="35%"}

### II-4. Behind Scene 4: Alice wins the game

After each move in the XO game, the XO smart contract checks the current game
state to determine if the move resulted in a win or a tie. If not, the game
state is updated to show which player moves next. (See
[Appendix D](#appendix-d-xo-smart-contract-specification) for the XO execution
rules and game state values.)

1. Before Alice's last move, the `xo_games` table in the database looks like
   this:

   <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>id</th>
       <th>circuit_id</th>
       <th>game_name</th>
       <th>player_1</th>
       <th>player_2</th>
     </tr>
     <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
       <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
       <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
       <td>alice_vs_bob</td>
       <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
       <td>&lt;Bob's public key&gt;</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
     <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
       <th>game_status</th>
       <th>game_board</th>
       <th>created_time</th>
       <th>updated_time</th>
     </tr>
     <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
       <td>P1-NEXT</td>
       <td>O-O-XOX-X</td>
       <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
       <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

    After Alice clicks the winning spot, the move is approved and committed to
    state, and the Gameroom daemons update the game state. Now, the `xo_games`
    table in the database looks like this:

    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>id</th>
        <th>circuit_id</th>
        <th>game_name</th>
        <th>player_1</th>
        <th>player_2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>&lt;auto generated id&gt;</td>
        <td>01234-ABCDE</td>
        <td>alice_vs_bob</td>
        <td>&lt;Alice's public key&gt;</td>
        <td>&lt;Bob's public key&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
      <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
        <th>game_status</th>
        <th>game_board</th>
        <th>created_time</th>
        <th>updated_time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
        <td>P1-WIN</td>
        <td>O-O-XOXXX</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was created&gt;</td>
        <td>&lt;time entry was updated&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    The `P1-WIN` game status means that neither player can make any more moves.

2. Each Gameroom daemon receives the notification of the game state change, as
   described for Alice's first move (see [section II-2](#ii-2-behind-scene-2-alice-makes-the-first-move))
   and Bob's first turn (see
   [section II-3](#ii-3-behind-scene-3-bob-takes-a-turn)).

3. Each Gameroom daemon notifies the Gameroom UI to update the game board with
   Alice's winning move on the game board, as described in those earlier
   sections.

    The Acme UI shows a green row to indicate that Alice has won. The Bubba
    Bakery UI shows the row in red to let Bob know that he has lost.

## Behind the Scenes: A Look at Act III, Alice creates Gamerooms with Yoda and Zixi

At the end of Act III, Alice has three gamerooms. Her gamerooms with Yoda and
Zixi are created the same way as the first gameroom with Bob in Act Ⅰ. The game
creation and XO gameplay transactions are the same as in Act II.

This section summarizes how Splinter manages circuits, services, and shared
state to keep each gameroom private and confidential.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/act3_diagram.svg %}
"Losing Bubba Bakery board")

A Splinter application, such as Gameroom, provides a set of distributed
services that can communicate with each other across a Splinter circuit. In
Gameroom, the Splinter software manages two-party private communication and
network-wide multi-party shared state, all managed with consensus.


- A **circuit** is a virtual network within the broader Splinter network that
  defines a visibility domain and securely enforces privacy scope boundaries.

- **Services** provide applications with a REST API to dynamically create new
  circuits, based on business need. A service is an endpoint within a circuit
  that sends and receives private messages.

- **Connections** are dynamically constructed between nodes as circuits are
  created.

The existence of a circuit is confidential: Participants can see only the
gamerooms that they have been invited to or have joined.

(**Note**:  The example Gameroom application handles gameroom access at the node
level. For example, any user on the Acme node can view and join an Acme
gameroom, including Alice's three gamerooms with Bob, Yoda, and Zixi. However,
other applications could choose to restrict participation at the user level.)

Alice sees her three gamerooms, but the other participants see only their one
gameroom with Alice. If Yoda and Zixi set up a Yoyodyne + Zymogen gameroom,
Alice wouldn't see it in her list of gamerooms.

Likewise, participant actions are private to the circuit. The transactions to
create a gameroom, start a new game, or make an XO move are private to the
participants in a gameroom. Shared state (a database updated by smart
contracts) is visible only to the services within a circuit.

## The Prequel: Setting Up the Gameroom Application

Before Act I starts, sysadmins installed the Gameroom application on Alice and
Bob's corporate networks, and both people are registered as Gameroom users.

This section describes the installation and user-registration process. It also
describes how the Gameroom application registers the Gameroom daemon for admin
service events.

### P.1: Running the Gameroom Demo with Docker

Gameroom is a demo Splinter application that allows you to set up dynamic two-
party circuits (called "gamerooms") and play tic tac toe with shared state, as
managed by two-phase commit consensus between the parties.


**Note**: This demo uses the Sabre smart contract engine provided in
[Sawtooth Sabre](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sabre/sabre_transaction_family.html)
and the XO smart contract provided in the [Hyperledger Sawtooth Rust SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples/xo_rust).


This example application includes a docker-compose file that sets up Splinter
nodes for two imaginary organizations: Acme Corporation and Bubba Bakery. Both
nodes are created on the same system so that this example is easy to run. For a
proof-of-concept or production network, however, each node should be on a
separate system.


Prerequisites: This demo requires [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

1. Clone the [splinter repository](https://github.com/Cargill/splinter).

2. To start Gameroom, run the following command from the Splinter root
   directory:

   ```
   $ docker-compose -f examples/gameroom/docker-compose.yaml up
   ```

3. Get Alice's and Bob's private keys to use in the web application. To display
   these keys, run bash using the `generate-key-registry` image, then read the
   private key.

   For example, to get Alice's private key, use these commands:

   ```
   $ docker-compose -f examples/gameroom/docker-compose.yaml \
   run generate-key-registry bash

   root@<container-id>:/# cat /key_registry/alice.priv; echo ""
   Alice's-private-key-value
   root@<container-id>:/#
   ```

4. In a browser, navigate to the Gameroom web application UI for each
   organization:

   - Acme UI: http://localhost:8080

   - Bubba Bakery UI: http://localhost:8081

5. When you are finished, shut down the demo.

    a. Enter CONTROL-C in the terminal window where you ran
       `docker-compose.yaml up`.

       ```
       ^C Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
       Stopping gameroomd-acme                   ... done
       Stopping gameroomd-bubba                  ... done
       Stopping gameroom-app-acme                ... done
       Stopping splinterd-node-acme              ... done
       Stopping splinterd-node-bubba             ... done
       Stopping db-acme                          ... done
       Stopping db-bubba                         ... done
       Stopping gameroom-app-bubba               ... done
       $
       ```

    b. Then shut down the docker containers with the following command:

       ```
       $ docker-compose -f examples/gameroom/docker-compose.yaml down
       ```

### P.2: Registering a User in the Gameroom UI

Each new user must register with the Gameroom application by specifying an
email address, providing their private key, and setting a password to use when
logging in.

When Alice navigates to the Gameroom application in her browser, the UI welcome
page includes an option to register.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/p2_1.png %}
"Register for Gameroom")

The Register page lets Alice enter her email address, private key, and
password. The Gameroom demo docker-compose file generates private keys for
Alice and Bob. See [section P.1](#p1-running-the-gameroom-demo-with-docker),
step 3 to learn how to display these private keys.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/p2_2.png %}
"Signup form")

After Alice registers, she is automatically logged in. The Acme Gameroom UI
displays the home page.

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/p2_3.png %}
"Gameroom home page"){:height="100%" width="100%"}

When a new user registers, the Gameroom daemon adds a new entry for that user
to the `gameroom_user` table in the local Gameroom database. The `gameroom_user`
table has the following schema:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gameroom_user (
  email            		TEXT    	PRIMARY KEY,
  public_key            	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
  encrypted_private_key 	TEXT    	NOT NULL,
  hashed_password       	TEXT    	NOT NULL
);
```

For example, an entry for a new user looks like this:

<table class ="gameroom_db_table" border="1">
  <tr class="gameroom_db_headers">
    <th>email</th>
    <th>hashed_password</th>
    <th>public_key</th>
    <th>encrypted_private_key</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="gameroom_db_data">
    <td>user@example.com</td>
    <td>56ec82cb...480cad32</td>
    <td>0384781f...5a7e4998</td>
    <td>{\"iv\":...cgXrm\"}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### P.3: Registering the Gameroom daemon for admin service events

The Gameroom application needs to receive notifications for admin service
events (described in [Appendix C](#appendix-c-circuit-proposal-events)) so that
it can react appropriately to circuit proposal events and other admin events.

To see these events, the Gameroom daemon (`gameroomd`) must register an
application authorization handler for circuits with a specific circuit
management type. This handler manages the voting strategy for the application
and notifies the application of any events received from the admin service on
the local Splinter node.

As part of the event registration, the application authorization handler must
specify the circuit management type. The `circuit_management_type` string in
the circuit definition briefly describes the purpose of the circuit. For
example, the Gameroom application uses the type `gameroom` for its circuits (see
the `CircuitManagementPayload` definition in
[section I-2.3](#i-23-gameroom-rest-api-sends-a-circuitmanagementpayload)).

When an event occurs (such as a new circuit proposal or vote), each admin
service uses a WebSocket connection to notify its application authorization
handler about the event. In order to receive WebSocket notifications, each
application authorization handler must send a registration request to its
Splinter node’s REST API.

For example, the Acme and Bubba Bakery Gameroom daemons would send this
registration request:

```
GET /ws/admin/register/gameroom
```

See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-circuit-proposal-events) for more information on
circuit events.

## Appendix A: Peer Authorization

This appendix describes the peer authorization process that occurs as part of
creating a circuit.

To be able to communicate on a Splinter network, each node and service involved
in the proposed circuit must go through authorization. Each node must authorize
with the other node (or nodes) involved in the circuit; each service must
authorize with its own node. After the node or service is authorized, its peer
ID (the node ID or service ID) is used to prove its identity.

Before a node or service is authorized, it can send only authorization messages
(in a specific order). If it sends any other messages before the connection is
authorized, those messages will be dropped.

### A.1: The Authorization Process

When the admin service on the first node (the node where the circuit request
originated) requests connections with the other members' nodes and services (as
described in [section I-2.4](#i-24-acme-node-peers-with-bubba-bakery-node)),
it starts the process of authorizing the nodes and services on those nodes.

1. First, the node or service requesting authorization is given a temporary
   peer ID with the following format:

    ```
    temp-<UUID>
    ```

2. Next, the node or service sends a `ConnectRequest` message wrapped in an
   `AuthorizationMessage`.

    The `ConnectRequest` specifies whether the authorization should be
    bidirectional (both sides) or unidirectional (one side only).

    - Connecting Splinter nodes should use bidirectional authorization, because
      each node must be authorized with the other node.

    - A Splinter service can use unidirectional authorization if it does not
      require the node to authorize itself with the service.

      The following example shows a bidirectional authorization request from a
      node.

    ```
    ---
    ConnectRequest:
        handshake_mode: BIDIRECTIONAL

    ---
    AuthorizationMessage:
      message_type: CONNECT_REQUEST
        payload: <bytes of connect request>
    ```

3. When a Splinter node receives a `ConnectRequest`, it responds with a
   `ConnectResponse` that includes a list of supported authorization types.
   Currently, the only supported authorization type is `Trust`, which means
   that the specified node or service (as identified by the peer ID) will be
   accepted as valid without any proof.

    ```
    ---
    ConnectResponse:
        accepted_authorization_types: [Trust]
    ```

4. When the node or service requesting authorization receives the
   `ConnectResponse`, it checks the list of accepted authorization types for a
   matching, supported authorization type. If both sides support `Trust`
   authorization, this node or service will send a `TrustRequest` message that
   includes its peer ID (either a node ID or service ID).

    ```
    ---
    TrustRequest:
        identity: <ID for the node or service>
    ```

5. When the node that is being connected to receives the `TrustRequest`, it
   changes the temporary peer ID to the actual peer ID (the node or service ID).

6. Next, this node sends an empty `AuthorizedMessage` to the connecting node or
   service to signify that it is now authorized to communicate on the Splinter
   network.

### A.2: Authorization Callbacks

When a new circuit is being created, the admin service may need to create a new
connection to Splinter nodes that are not currently connected. This is done
using the `PeerConnector`, as described in
[section I-2.4](#i-24-acme-node-peers-with-bubba-bakery-node). Before the admin
service completes authorization, any `AdminDirectMessage` it sends will be
dropped. This section describes how authorization callbacks are used to notify
a node or service (such as the admin service) when the authorization process is
complete.

The `AuthorizationInquisitor` interrogates the authorization status for a given
peer ID, and includes a callback registration function to notify the caller of
changes in peer authorization.

The `AuthorizationInquisitor` provides two methods:

- `is_authorized` checks whether a specific peer ID is registered

- `register_callback`, which takes a boxed `AuthorizationCallback`, requests
   notification when a peer's authorization status changes

```rust
pub trait AuthorizationInquisitor: Send {
    /// Register a callback to receive notifications about peer
    /// authorization statuses.
    fn register_callback(
      &self,
      callback: Box<dyn AuthorizationCallback>,
    ) -> Result<(), AuthorizationCallbackError>;

    /// Indicates whether or not a peer is authorized.
    fn is_authorized(&self, peer_id: &str) -> bool;
}
```

An `AuthorizationCallback` is a trait that must implement an
`on_authorization_change` function that is called by the
`AuthorizationInquisitor` when a peer's authorization status change. It takes
the peer ID of the node or service whose authorization status has changed and
the new `PeerAuthorizationState` (either `Authorized` or `Unauthorized`).

```rust
pub enum PeerAuthorizationState {
  Authorized,
  Unauthorized,
}

/// A callback for changes in a peer's authorization state.
pub trait AuthorizationCallback: Send {
    /// This function is called when a peer's state changes to Authorized
    /// or Unauthorized.
    fn on_authorization_change(
      &self,
      peer_id: &str,
      state: PeerAuthorizationState,
    ) -> Result<(), AuthorizationCallbackError>;
}
```

The admin service is passed an `AuthorizationInquisitor` on startup. Then the
admin service registers an `AuthorizationCallback` that will remove pending
payloads from the `unpeered_payload` queue and move them the pending circuit
payload queue once all required members have successfully peered and authorized.

## Appendix B: Consensus

Consensus is used to reach agreement between multiple parties.

Within Splinter, consensus refers to a library that contains consensus
algorithm implementations (called "consensus engines") and a single interface
for using those algorithms. Splinter services are typically the consumers of
this interface.

In the Gameroom application, both the admin service and the scabbard service
use a consensus algorithm called *two-phase commit*, which is a basic consensus
algorithm that requires all participating parties to agree. If any party
disagrees, the consensus proposal (the item being considered) is rejected. The
Gameroom example uses two-phase commit for items such as circuit proposals,
proposal validation, and transactions to add a smart contract.

### B.1: Consensus Interface

The consensus interface defines the relationship between a service and a
consensus engine.

A `Proposal` is the entity that consensus agrees on; it contains a summary of
the underlying data that a service would like to commit, as well as information
that may be useful to consensus. The Proposal is defined as a protobuf:

```
message Proposal {
  // The proposal’s identifier, which is a hash of `previous_id`,
  // `proposal_height`, and `summary`
  bytes id = 1;
  // The identifier of the proposal’s immediate predecessor
  bytes previous_id = 2;
  // The number of proposals preceding this one (used for ordering
  // purposes)
  uint64 proposal_height = 3;
  // A summary of the data this proposal represents
  bytes summary = 4;
  // Opaque data that is provided by the consensus algorithm
  bytes consensus_data = 5;
}
```

A message sent between consensus engines is called a `ConsensusMessage`, and is
defined by the following protobuf:

```
message ConsensusMessage {
  // An opaque message that is interpreted by the consensus algorithm
  bytes message = 1;
  // ID of the service that created this message
  bytes origin_id = 2;
}
```

A service that uses consensus must implement two Rust traits for the consensus
engine to interact with: the `ProposalManager` trait, which manages the
`Proposals` that consensus decides on, and the `ConsensusNetwork` trait, which
an engine uses to send messages to other nodes’ consensus engines.

The consensus algorithm itself is implemented using the `ConsensusEngine` trait.

### B.2: Two-Phase Commit

Two-phase commit (2PC) is a basic consensus algorithm that requires agreement
from all parties in order to accept a proposal.

The following diagram summarizes the operation of this algorithm. It shows the
activities on two nodes for the consensus engines (2PC-1 and 2PC-2), the
proposal managers (PM-1 and PM-2), and the consensus network senders (NS-1 and
NS-2).

![]({% link
docs/0.4/examples/gameroom/walkthrough/images/two_phase_commit_diagram.svg %}
"Two-Phase Commit")

#### B.2.1: `TwoPhaseMessage` Types

Two-phase commit has three message types that are sent between its consensus
engines: `PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_REQUEST`, `PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_RESPONSE`, and
`PROPOSAL_RESULT`. The following `TwoPhaseMessage` protobuf defines these
message types.

```
message TwoPhaseMessage {
  enum Type {
      UNSET_TYPE = 0;
      PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_REQUEST = 1;
      PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_RESPONSE = 2;
      PROPOSAL_RESULT = 3;
  }

  enum ProposalVerificationResponse {
      UNSET_VERIFICATION_RESPONSE = 0;
      VERIFIED = 1;
      FAILED = 2;
  }

  enum ProposalResult {
      UNSET_RESULT = 0;
      APPLY = 1;
      REJECT = 2;
  }

  Type message_type = 1;

  bytes proposal_id = 2;

  ProposalVerificationResponse proposal_verification_response = 3;
  ProposalResult proposal_result = 4;
}
```

To send a message to one of its peers, the two-phase commit engine constructs
the `TwoPhaseMessage` protobuf, serializes it into bytes, and passes it to the
`ConsensusNetworkSender`, which will then wrap it in a `ConsensusMessage` and
relay it to one or more peers.

When a two-phase engine receives a consensus message, it extracts and
deserializes the `TwoPhaseMessage` protobuf, then handles the message.

#### B.2.2: Startup

When a service using two-phase commit starts up, it creates the consensus
engine and runs it in a new thread.

#### B.2.3: Proposal Creation

The two-phase commit consensus engine can create new proposals when it  is not
already performing consensus on a proposal. To create a new proposal, the
consensus engine requests a new proposal from the Splinter service using the
`ProposalManager.create_proposal()` method.

- If the service has data for consensus to agree on, it will create a proposal
  for that data and send it to consensus as a `ProposalCreated(Some(Proposal))`
  update.

- If the service does *not* have data for consensus, it will send a
  `ProposalCreated(None)` update to consensus, and consensus will ask again
  after a brief timeout.

After sending the new proposal to the consensus engine, the service sends the
data (the item to be decided on) to the other services in the circuit. The
other services send the new proposal to their respective consensus engines as
a `ProposalReceived(Proposal, PeerId)` update, where the `PeerId` is the ID of
the consensus engine that created the proposal.

#### B.2.4: Coordinator and Initial Verification

A `ProposalManager` is a Rust trait that must be implemented for a Splinter
service and is used by the consensus engine to create, check, accept, and
reject proposals

When a two-phase commit engine determines that it is the coordinator for a new
proposal, it first asks its service to verify the proposal using the
`ProposalManager.check_proposal()` method.

If the proposal is valid, the proposal manager replies with a
`ProposalValid(ProposalId)` update; if it is invalid, it will reply with a
`ProposalInvalid(ProposalId)` update.

- In the case of an invalid proposal, the coordinator will simply reject the
  proposal by calling `ProposalManager.reject_proposal()` and instruct its
  peers to do the same by broadcasting a `ProposalResult::REJECT` message.

- In the case of a valid proposal, the coordinator will request verification
  from the other verifying peers.

#### B.2.5: Verification

To request verification from the verifying peers, the coordinator broadcasts a
`PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_REQUEST` for the proposal using the service’s
`ConsensusNetworkSender.broadcast()` method.

When each verifying consensus engine receives the
`PROPOSAL_VERIFICATION_REQUEST` from the coordinator, it verifies the proposal
itself by calling its service's `ProposalManager.check_proposal()` method and
waiting for a response.

- If the verifier receives a `ProposalValid` update from its proposal manager,
  it will send a `ProposalVerificationResponse::VERIFIED` message to the
  coordinator using its service’s `ConsensusNetworkSender.send_to()` method.

- If the verifier receives a `ProposalInvalid` update, it will send a
  `ProposalVerificationResponse::FAILED` message to the coordinator.

#### B.2.6: Proposal Result and Commit/Reject

If the coordinator receives a `ProposalVerificationResponse::FAILED` response,
the consensus engine tells the `ProposalsManager.reject_proposal`, which will
roll back any changes being stored in the service.

If the coordinator receives a `ProposalVerificationResponse::VERIFIED`, the
consensus engine checks whether it has received a verification response from
every peer. If the engine has received all verification requests, it accepts
the proposal and calls `ProposalsManager.accept_proposal`, which will commit
the pending changes in the Splinter service.

The coordinator then sends a message about the `ProposalResult` to its peers,
with either an `APPLY` or `REJECT` result. This notifies the other peers they
should also accept or reject the proposals.

## Appendix C: Circuit Proposal Events

During Gameroom setup (see
[The Prequel](#the-prequel-setting-up-the-gameroom-application)),
each node's Gameroom application authorization handler is registered as an
authorization handler for the Gameroom application. This handler receives
messages (via a WebSocket connection) about circuit proposal events.

1. The application authorization handler, which is part of the Gameroom daemon,
   sends a request to the Splinter REST API to register as an authorization
   handler for the Gameroom application. The request is a WebSocket handshake
   request that looks like this:

    ```
    GET /ws/admin/register/gameroom
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-Websocket-Version: 13
    Sec-Websocket-key:  13
    ```

2. If the request is successful, the server sends a response indicating that
   the protocol will change from HTTP to WebSocket. The response looks like
   this:

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
    ```

3. After the protocol has been upgraded, the Gameroom Application Authorization
   Handler receives messages (via the WebSocket connection) about circuit
   proposal events related to the Gameroom application. The event types include:

    - `ProposalSubmitted`
    - `ProposalRejected`
    - `ProposalAccepted`
    - `ProposalVote`
    - `CircuitReady`

These event messages are serialized JSON.

## Appendix D: XO Smart Contract Specification

The XO smart contract allows users to play the simple board game tic tac toe
(also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "X’s and O’s").

### D.1: XO State Entries

An XO state entry consists of the UTF-8 encoding of a string with exactly four
commas, which has the following format:

```
<game-name>,<game-board>,<game-state>,<player1-key>,<player2-key>
```

- `<game-name>` is the name of the game, as a non-empty string that does not
   contain the character `|`.

- `<game-board>` represents the game board as a 9-character string (called "the
   board string") that contains only `O`, `X`, or `-`.

- `<game-state>` is one of the following: `P1-NEXT`, `P2-NEXT`, `P1-WIN`,
   `P2-WIN`, or `TIE`. (`P1` and `P2` stand for "player 1" and "player 2".)

- `<player1-key>` and `<player2-key>` are the (possibly empty) public keys
   associated with the game’s players.

In the event of a hash collision (two or more state entries sharing the same
address), the colliding state entries are stored as the UTF-8 encoding of the
following string, with entries sorted alphabetically:

```
<a-entry>|<b-entry>|...
```

#### D.1.1: State Adressing

XO data is stored in state using addresses generated from the XO "family name"
(explained below) and the name of the game being stored.

In particular, an XO address consists of the first 6 characters of the SHA-512
hash of the UTF-8 encoding of the string `“xo”` (which is `“5b7349”`), plus the
first 64 characters of the SHA-512 hash of the UTF-8 encoding of the game name.

For example, the XO address for a game called “mygame” could be generated as
follows:

```
>>> hashlib.sha512('xo'.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()[:6] +
    hashlib.sha512('mygame'.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()[:64]
'5b7349700e158b598043efd6d7610345a75a00b22ac14c9278db53f586179a92b72fbd'
```

### D.2: XO Transaction Payload

An XO transaction request payload consists of the UTF-8 encoding of a string
with exactly two commas, which is formatted as follows:

```
<name>,<action>,<space>
```

- `<name>` is the game name, as a non-empty string not containing the character
  `|`. If `<action>` is create, the new name must be unique.

- `<action>` is the game action: `create`, `take`, or `delete`.

- `<space>` is the location on the board, as an integer between 1-9
  (inclusive), if `<action>` is `take`.

### D.3: XO Transaction Header

Each XO transaction must include a header with the required inputs and outputs,
plus the XO "family name" and version.

#### D.3.1: Inputs and Outputs

The inputs and outputs for an XO transaction are just the state address
generated from the transaction game name.

#### D.3.2: Dependencies

XO transactions have no explicit dependencies.

#### D.3.3: Family Name and Version

Each smart contract has a "family name", which identifies the smart contract
type, and a version number. The term "family" comes from the XO transaction
family (and transaction processor) in Hyperledger Sawtooth, which is an off-
chain version of the XO business logic.

- `family_name: "xo"`

- `family_version: "1.0"`

### D.4: XO Execution

When a running XO smart contract receives a transaction request and a state
dictionary, it checks the validity of the request. A valid transaction request
payload has a game name, an action, and (if the action is `take`) a space.

Next, the XO smart contract checks whether the transaction (the requested
action) is valid, then updates the state entry according to the specified
action.

- If the action is `create`, the transaction is invalid if the game name is
  already in state dictionary. Otherwise, the smart contract will store a new
  state entry with board `---------` (a blank board), game state `P1-NEXT`, and
  empty strings for both player keys.

- If the action is `delete`, the transaction is invalid if the game name is not
  in the state dictionary. Otherwise, the smart contract will delete the state
  entry for the game.

- If the action is `take`, the transaction is invalid if the game name is not
  in the state dictionary. Otherwise, there is a state entry under the game
  name with a board, game state, player-1 key, and player-2 key.

When the action is `take`, the smart contract updates the game's state entry
as follows:

1. If the game name is in the state dictionary, the transaction is invalid
   if one of the following is true:

    - The game state is `P1-WIN`, `P2-WIN`, or `TIE`

    - The game state is `P1-NEXT`, the player-1 key is not null, and the
      player-1 key is different from the transaction signing key

    - The game state is `P2-NEXT`, the player-2 key is not null, and the
      player-2 key is different from the transaction signing key

    - The specified ("space-th") character in the board string has already
      been claimed (is not `-`).


2. Otherwise, the smart contract will update the state entry as follows:

    a. **Player keys**: If the player-1 key is null (the empty string), it will
       be updated to the key with which the transaction was signed. If the
       player-1 key is not null and the player-2 key is null, the player-2
       key will be updated to the signing key. Otherwise, the player keys
       will not be changed.

    b. **Board**: If the game state is `P1-NEXT`, the board will be updated with
       an `X` (player 1's character) in the specified space. That is, the
       updated board will be the same as the initial board, except with the
       "space-th" character replaced by the character X. If the game state is
       `P2-NEXT`, the same action occurs with an `O` (player 2's character).

    c. **Game state**: The smart contract updates the game state based on the
       contents of the board string. In this description, the first three
       characters of the board string represent the first row, the next three
       characters are the second row, and the last three characters are the
       third row.

      A character has a win on the board if any of the following is true:

      - If any row consists of the same character.

      - If the same character appears in a column (all the rows have the
        same first or second or third character).

      - If the same character appears in a diagonal line (the first
        character/first row, second character/second row, and third
        character/third row are the same; or the third character /first
        row, second character/second row, and first character/third row are
        the same).


3. Then the smart contract checks for a tie:

    - If `X` has a win on the board and `O` doesn’t, the updated state will be
      `P1-WINS`.

    - If `O` has a win on the board and `X` doesn’t, the updated state will be
      `P2-WINS`.

    - Otherwise, if the updated board has no empty spaces (does not contain
      `-`), the updated state will be `TIE`.

    - Otherwise, the game continues and the other player takes a turn. If the
      initial state was `P1-NEXT`, the updated state will be `P2-NEXT`.
      Conversely, if the initial state was `P2-NEXT`, the updated state will
      be `P1-NEXT`.

#### state delta export
<p class="glossary-definition">
Process of reading state-change updates from Splinter and uploading them to a
local database. An application provides this functionality in a state delta
processor (or state delta export process). For example, the Gameroom
application registers for XO smart contract updates and uses the
<code>XoStateDeltaProcessor</code> to process the information.
</p>

#### two-phase commit
