The Splinter documentation guidelines are a work in progress.
For items not covered here, see
[plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/),
the [Merriam-Webster's online dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/),
and the [Google developer documentation style
guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
Many thanks to the Google writers who provide this clear, comprehensive guide.

* Be consistent.

* Follow the [Splinter capitalization
  guidelines]({% link community/doc_guidelines/capitalization.md %}).

* Note these conventions and best practices. (Follow the links for more
  information in the Google developer documentation style guide.)

    - Use standard American English
      [spelling](https://developers.google.com/style/spelling),
      [punctuation](https://developers.google.com/style/semicolons),
      [capitalization](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization),
      and [abbreviations](https://developers.google.com/style/abbreviations).

    - [Use serial commas](https://developers.google.com/style/commas) (also
      called Oxford commas) before "and" or "or" in lists.

    - [Use "-s" verb forms](https://developers.google.com/style/reference-verbs)
      in reference documentation, including API and CLI guides, command usage
      statements (`--help` output), and man pages.

    - [Use present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense).
      Avoid "will", "would", and "shall".

    - [Put conditional clauses before
      instructions](https://developers.google.com/style/clause-order), not after.

    - [Avoid ambiguous pronoun
      references](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns).
      Ensure that a pronoun clearly refers to its antecedent (the noun that
      it's replacing).

    - Use appropriate list formatting. [Use numbered
      lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists) for ordered sequences.
      [Use bulleted lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists) for most
      other lists.

    - [Use active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice). Make clear
      who's performing an action.

    - [Use second person](https://developers.google.com/style/person) when
      addressing the reader: "you" rather than "we".

    - [Don't use a filename extension to refer to a type of
      file](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#letter-p). Write PDF
      (not .pdf or pdf), TOML, YAML, and so on.

* For punctuation and font changes, use [Google's text-formatting
  guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting).

* For wording and terminology, see [Google's Word
  list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list).

* Differentiate between code objects and descriptive phrases in the text. (For
  example, `ConnectionManager` versus "the connection manager".)

    - If possible, use a descriptive phrase instead of a CamelCase code name.

    - Use articles (the, a) with descriptive phrases and put spaces between the
      words. When using the code name, format it in a constant-width font (using
      Markdown backticks).

      **Good**: "The connection manager is ..."

      **Good**: "This example uses `ConnectionManager` to ..."

      *Avoid*: "The ConnectionManager is ..."

* Check your spelling.

* Use these [editing
  strategies](https://writersworkshop.web.illinois.edu/resources-2/writer-resources/writing-processes/editing-and-proofreading/).

* See [George Orwell's six rules for
  writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language#Remedy_of_Six_Rules).
