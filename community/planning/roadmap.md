The following is a tentative roadmap to future releases.

Splinter uses an odd/even release numbering. Even minor numbers (v0.4, v0.6)
are stable releases, while odd minor numbers (v0.3, v0.5) are developer
releases.  Only stable releases are covered on the roadmap.

## Splinter v0.6

Splinter v0.6 addresses critical areas required for running Splinter in
production, which brings Splinter to a huge milestone: v0.6 is expected to be
suitable for low-volume production environments which can withstand some amount
of downtime for upgrades or single-point-of-failure issues.

## Splinter v0.8

This release is still in early planning.

This release will likely contain high availability and failover support for
transaction processing. The high availability journey begins here because
transaction processing involves technically complex parts of the system:
a merkle tree with provable state agreement and consensus algorithms.  High
availability of other Splinter components will continue in subsequent releases.

The release will likely also contain performance metrics collection and
performance tuning of transaction processing.

Thus, Splinter v0.8 is expected to be suitable for low-to-medium-volume
production environments which can withstand some amount of downtime for
upgrades or single-point-of-failure issues (due to remaining non-HA
components).

## Additional Information

### Management of the Roadmap

The roadmap is a collaborative effort derived from both agile community
feedback and long-term vision. Communities building other open source projects
which are built upon Splinter, such as Hyperledger Grid and Hyperledger
Sawtooth, have a substantial impact on the roadmap. Non-public projects also
have a substantial impact.
